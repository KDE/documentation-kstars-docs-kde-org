The Ecliptic
============

         **John Cirillo**

         The ecliptic is an imaginary :doc:`Great
         Circle  <ai-greatcircle>` on the :doc:`Celestial
         Sphere  <ai-csphere>` along which the Sun appears to move
         over the course of a year. Of course, it is really the Earth's
         orbit around the Sun causing the change in the Sun's apparent
         direction. The ecliptic is inclined from the :doc:`Celestial
         Equator  <ai-cequator>` by 23.5 degrees. The two points
         where the Ecliptic crosses the Celestial Equator are known as
         the :doc:`Equinoxes  <ai-equinox>`.

         Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the
         planets are also close to the plane of the ecliptic. In
         addition, the constellations of the zodiac are located along
         the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very useful line of
         reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the
         constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally “follow
         the Sun”.

         Because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Ecliptic, the *Altitude*
         of the Sun at noon changes over the course of the year, as it
         follows the path of the Ecliptic across the sky. This causes
         the seasons. In the Summer, the Sun is high in the sky at noon,
         and it remains above the :doc:`Horizon  <ai-horizon>` for more
         than twelve hours. Whereas, in the winter, the Sun is low in
         the sky at noon, and remains above the Horizon for less than
         twelve hours. In addition, sunlight is received at the Earth's
         surface at a more direct angle in the Summer, which means that
         a given area at the surface receives more energy per second in
         the Summer than in Winter. The differences in day duration and
         in energy received per unit area lead to the differences in
         temperature we experience in Summer and Winter.

            Exercises:

            Make sure your location is set to somewhere that is not very
            near the equator for these experiments. Open the ``Configure -
            KStars`` window, and switch to Horizontal coordinates, with
            the Opaque Ground shown. Open the ``Set Time`` window
            (**Ctrl**\ +\ **S**),and change the Date to sometime in the
            middle of Summer, and the Time to 12:00 Noon. Back in the
            Main Window, point toward the Southern Horizon (press
            **S**). Note the height of the Sun above the Horizon at Noon
            in the Summer. Now, change the Date to something in the
            middle of Winter (but keep the Time at 12:00 Noon). The Sun
            is now much lower in the Sky. You will also notice that the
            day durations are different if you open the ``What's up
            Tonight?`` tool for each date.
