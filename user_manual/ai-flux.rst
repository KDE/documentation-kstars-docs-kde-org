         The *flux* is the amount of energy that passes through a unit
         area each second.

         Astronomers use flux to denote the apparent brightness of a
         celestial body. The apparent brightness is defined as the
         amount of light received from a star above the earth atmosphere
         passing through a unit area each second. Therefore, the
         apparent brightness is simply the flux we receive from a star.

         The flux measures the *rate of flow* of energy that passes
         through each cm\ :sup:`2` (or any unit area) of an object's
         surface each second. The detected flux depends on the distance
         from the source that radiates the energy. This is because the
         energy has to spread over a volume of space before it reaches
         us. Let us assume that we have an imaginary balloon that
         encloses a star. Each dot on the balloon represents a unit of
         energy emitted from the star. Initially, the dots in an area of
         one cm\ :sup:`2` are in close proximity to each other and the
         flux (energy emitted per square centimeter per second) is high.
         After a distance d, the volume and surface area of the balloon
         increased causing the dots to *spread away* from each.
         Consequently, the number of dots (or energy) enclosed in one
         cm\ :sup:`2` has decreased as illustrated in Figure 1.

         The flux is inversely proportional to distance by a simple
         r\ :sup:`2` relation. Therefore, if the distance is doubled, we
         receive 1/2\ :sup:`2` or 1/4th of the original flux. From a
         fundamental standpoint, the flux is the
         :doc:`luminosity  <ai-luminosity>` per unit area:

            |image3|

         where (4 \* Ï€ \* R\ :sup:`2`) is the surface area of a sphere
         (or a balloon!) with a radius R. Flux is measured in
         Watts/m\ :sup:`2`/s or as commonly used by astronomers:
         Ergs/cm\ :sup:`2`/s. For example, the luminosity of the sun is
         L = 3.90 \* 10\ :sup:`26` W. That is, in one second the sun
         radiates 3.90 \* 10\ :sup:`26` joules of energy into space.
         Thus, the flux we receive passing through one square centimeter
         from the sun at a distance of one AU (1.496 \* 10\ :sup:`13`
         cm) is:
