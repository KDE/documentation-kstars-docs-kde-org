Blackbody Radiation
===================

         A *blackbody* refers to an opaque object that emits *thermal
         radiation*. A perfect blackbody is one that absorbs all
         incoming light and does not reflect any. At room temperature,
         such an object would appear to be perfectly black (hence the
         term *blackbody*). However, if heated to a high temperature, a
         blackbody will begin to glow with *thermal radiation*.

         In fact, all objects emit thermal radiation (as long as their
         temperature is above Absolute Zero, or -273.15 degrees
         Celsius), but no object emits thermal radiation perfectly;
         rather, they are better at emitting/absorbing some wavelengths
         of light than others. These uneven efficiencies make it
         difficult to study the interaction of light, heat and matter
         using normal objects.

         Fortunately, it is possible to construct a nearly-perfect
         blackbody. Construct a box made of a thermally conductive
         material, such as metal. The box should be completely closed on
         all sides, so that the inside forms a cavity that does not
         receive light from the surroundings. Then, make a small hole
         somewhere on the box. The light coming out of this hole will
         almost perfectly resemble the light from an ideal blackbody,
         for the temperature of the air inside the box.

         At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists Lord Rayleigh,
         and Max Planck (among others) studied the blackbody radiation
         using such a device. After much work, Planck was able to
         empirically describe the intensity of light emitted by a
         blackbody as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, he was able
         to describe how this spectrum would change as the temperature
         changed. Planck's work on blackbody radiation is one of the
         areas of physics that led to the foundation of the wonderful
         science of Quantum Mechanics, but that is unfortunately beyond
         the scope of this article.

         What Planck and the others found was that as the temperature of
         a blackbody increases, the total amount of light emitted per
         second increases, and the wavelength of the spectrum's peak
         shifts to bluer colors (see Figure 1).

         For example, an iron bar becomes orange-red when heated to high
         temperatures and its color progressively shifts toward blue and
         white as it is heated further.

         In 1893, German physicist Wilhelm Wien quantified the
         relationship between blackbody temperature and the wavelength
         of the spectral peak with the following equation:

            |image3|

         where T is the temperature in Kelvin. Wien's law (also known as
         Wien's displacement law) states that the wavelength of maximum
         emission from a blackbody is inversely proportional to its
         temperature. This makes sense; shorter-wavelength
         (higher-frequency) light corresponds to higher-energy photons,
         which you would expect from a higher-temperature object.

         For example, the sun has an average temperature of 5800 K, so
         its wavelength of maximum emission is given by:

            |image4|

         This wavelengths falls in the green region of the visible light
         spectrum, but the sun's continuum radiates photons both longer
         and shorter than lambda(max) and the human eyes perceives the
         sun's color as yellow/white.

         In 1879, Austrian physicist Stephan Josef Stefan showed that
         the luminosity, L, of a black body is proportional to the 4th
         power of its temperature T.

         where A is the surface area, alpha is a constant of
         proportionality, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. That is,
         if we double the temperature (e.g. 1000 K to 2000 K) then the
         total energy radiated from a blackbody increase by a factor of
         2\ :sup:`4` or 16.

         Five years later, Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzman derived
         the same equation and is now known as the Stefan-Boltzman law.
         If we assume a spherical star with radius R, then the
         luminosity of such a star is

            |image6|

         where R is the star radius in cm, and the alpha is the
         Stefan-Boltzman constant, which has the value:
