Universal Time
==============

         **Jason Harris**

         The time on our clocks is essentially a measurement of the
         current position of the Sun in the sky, which is different for
         places at different Longitudes because the Earth is round (see
         :doc:`Time Zones  <ai-timezones>`).

         However, it is sometimes necessary to define a global time, one
         that is the same for all places on Earth. One way to do this is
         to pick a place on the Earth, and adopt the Local Time at that
         place as the *Universal Time*, abbreviated UT. (The name is a
         bit of a misnomer, since Universal Time has little to do with
         the Universe. It would perhaps be better to think of it as
         *global time*).

         The geographic location chosen to represent Universal Time is
         Greenwich, England. The choice is arbitrary and historical.
         Universal Time became an important concept when European ships
         began to sail the wide open seas, far from any known landmarks.
         A navigator could reckon the ship's longitude by comparing the
         Local Time (as measured from the Sun's position) to the time
         back at the home port (as kept by an accurate clock on board
         the ship). Greenwich was home to England's Royal Observatory,
         which was charged with keeping time very accurately, so that
         ships in port could re-calibrate their clocks before setting
         sail.

            Exercise:

            Set the geographic location to “Greenwich, England” using
            the ``Set Location`` window (**Ctrl**\ +\ **G**). Note that the
            Local Time (LT) and the Universal Time (UT) are now the
            same.

            Further Reading: The history behind the construction of the
            first clock that was accurate and stable enough to be used
            on ships to keep Universal Time is a fascinating tale, and
            one told expertly in the book “Longitude”, by Dava Sobel.
