StellarMate is shipped with a VNC Server. This enables you to access the whole StellarMate desktop remotely. To connect to VNC, you can either use a Desktop/Mobile VNC Client, or simply via any browser.

The VNC address is: **https://stellarmate_hostname:6080/vnc.html**

Where ``stellarmate_hostname`` is the actual hostname (or IP address) of your unit and 6080 is the port. If you do not know the unit hostname, you can find the hostname in your StellarMate App.

You can use `Real VNC <https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/>`__ which is available on all platforms to access stellarmate.

Once you access StellarMate, you can use it like any full-fledged computer. The default username is **stellarmate** and the default password is **smate**.
