The Configure KStars Window
===========================

The ``Configure - KStars`` window allows you to modify a wide range
of display options. You can access the window with the
``Configure toolbar`` icon, or by selecting the ``Settings`` â†’
``Configure KStars...`` menu item. The window is depicted below:

    |Configure - KStars Window|

The ``Configure - KStars`` window is divided into fourteen pages:
``Catalogs``, ``Solar System``, ``Satellites``, ``Supernovae``, ``Guides``,
``Terrain``, ``Image Overlays``, ``Colors``, ``FITS``, ``INDI``, ``Ekos``, ``Xplanet``,
``Advanced`` and ``Developer``.

In the ``Catalogs`` page, you determine several properties
concerning the display of the star and deep sky object
catalogs.

In the ``Solar System`` page, you can specify whether the Sun,
Moon, planets, comets and asteroids are displayed.

The ``Satellites`` page allows you to set the satellites view
options.

The ``Supernovae`` page allows you to manage how supernovae are
displayed by KStars.

The ``Guides`` page lets you toggle whether non-objects are
displayed (i.e., constellation lines, constellation names, the
Milky Way contour).

    It is possible to choose a ``Sky culture``: for the
    constellation lines and names on this page. The current
    version of KStars includes data for more than a dozen sky
    cultures.

The ``Terrain page`` allows you to set the terrain or landscape
image and configure its speedup options.

The ``Image Overlays`` page allows you to add and manage your own
images that will be displayed in the skymap.

The ``Colors`` page allows you to set the color scheme, and to
define new custom color schemes.

For detailed explanation of the options on the ``FITS`` page see
the :doc:`Configure FITS  <fits-configure>` section.

For detailed explanation of the options on the ``INDI`` page see
the :doc:`Configure INDI  <indi-configure>` section.

For detailed explanation of ``Ekos`` astrophotography suite, see
the :doc:`Ekos section of this manual  <ekos>`.

The ``Xplanet`` page provides fine-grained control over `Solar
system planet surface renderer
Xplanet <http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/>`__ (should be
installed separately).

The ``Advanced`` page provides fine-grained control over the more
subtle behaviors of KStars.

The ``Developer`` page allows you to enable or disable a few
options mostly useful for developers or for folks looking to
help debug issues. Currently these are enabling the saving of
images during Ekos's autofocus, guiding and alignment.
