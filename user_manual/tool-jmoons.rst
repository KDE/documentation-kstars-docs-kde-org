This tool displays the positions of Jupiter's four largest
moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) relative to Jupiter,
as a function of time. Time is plotted vertically; the units
are days and “time=0.0” corresponds to the current simulation
time. The horizontal axis displays the angular offset from
Jupiter's position, in arcminutes. The offset is measured along
the direction of Jupiter's equator. Each moon's position as a
function of time traces a sinusoidal path in the plot, as the
moon orbits around Jupiter. Each track is assigned a different
color to distinguish it from the others; the name labels at the
top of the window indicate the color used by each moon (i.e.
red for Io, yellow for Europa, green for Callisto and blue for
Ganymede).

The plot can be manipulated with the keyboard. The time axis
can be expanded or compressed using the **+** and **-** keys.
The time displayed at the center of the window can be changed
with the **[** and **]** keys.
