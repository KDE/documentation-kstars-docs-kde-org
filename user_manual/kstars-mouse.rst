Mouse Commands
==============

Moving the mouse
  The sky coordinates (Az/Alt, RA/Dec and J2000.0 RA/Dec) of the mouse cursor are updated in the status bar. The status bar is located in the right bottom corner of the screen. The status bar can be customized by selecting ``Settings → Statusbar`` submenu. Here you may choose what coordinates systems KStars will display in the status bar. Furthermore, you can hide the status bar by unchecking the ``Show Statusbar`` checkbox.

"Hovering" the mouse
  A temporary name label is attached to the object nearest to the mouse cursor.

Left-clicking
  The object nearest the mouse click is identified in the status bar.

Double-clicking
  Center and track on the location or object nearest the mouse click. Double-clicking on an Info Box will “shade” it to show/hide extra information.

Right-clicking
  Open the :ref:`popup menu <commands-popup-menu>` for the location or object nearest the mouse cursor.

Scrolling the mouse wheel
  Zoom the display in or out. If you do not have a mouse wheel, you can hold the middle mouse button and drag vertically.

Click-and-dragging

  Dragging the sky map
    Pan the display, following the drag motion.

  **Ctrl** +dragging the sky map
    Define a rectangle in the map. When the mouse button is released, the display is zoomed in to match the field-of-view to the bounds of the rectangle.

  Dragging an Info Box
    The Info Box is repositioned in the map. Info Boxes will “stick” to window edges, so that they remain on the edge when the window is resized.
