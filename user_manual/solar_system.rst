   |Solar System Window|

In the ``Solar System`` page, you can specify whether the Sun, Moon, planets, comets and asteroids are displayed, and whether the major bodies are drawn as colored circles or actual images.  You can also toggle whether solar system bodies have name labels attached, and control how many of the comets and asteroids get name labels. There is an option to automatically attach a temporary “orbit trail” whenever a solar system body is tracked, and another to toggle whether the color of the orbit trail fades into the background sky color.
