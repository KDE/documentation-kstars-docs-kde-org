         As explained in the :doc:`Sidereal Time  <ai-sidereal>`
         article, the *Right Ascension* of an object indicates the
         Sidereal Time at which it will transit across your :doc:`Local
         Meridian  <ai-meridian>`. An object's *Hour Angle* is
         defined as the difference between the current Local Sidereal
         Time and the Right Ascension of the object:

         HA\ :sub:`obj` = LST - RA\ :sub:`obj`

         Thus, the object's Hour Angle indicates how much Sidereal Time
         has passed since the object was on the Local Meridian. It is
         also the angular distance between the object and the meridian,
         measured in hours (1 hour = 15 degrees). For example, if an
         object has an hour angle of 2.5 hours, it transited across the
         Local Meridian 2.5 hours ago, and is currently 37.5 degrees
         West of the Meridian. Negative Hour Angles indicate the time
         until the *next* transit across the Local Meridian. Of course,
         an Hour Angle of zero means the object is currently on the
         Local Meridian.
