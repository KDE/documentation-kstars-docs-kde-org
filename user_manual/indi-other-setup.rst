CCD and Video-Capture Setup
===========================

You can run CCD and Video Capture devices from the ``Tools →
Devices → Device Manager...`` menu item. Like all INDI devices,
some of the device controls will be accessible from the skymap.
The device can be controlled fully from the ``INDI Control
Panel...`` item.

The standard format for image capture is FITS. Once an image is
captured and downloaded, it will be automatically displayed in
the KStars :doc:`FITS Viewer <fitsviewer>`.
