====================
The Celestial Sphere
====================

         **Jason Harris**

         The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius,
         centered on the Earth. All objects which can be seen in the sky
         can be thought of as lying on the surface of this sphere.

         Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not on the
         surface of a sphere centered on the Earth, so why bother with
         such a construct? Everything we see in the sky is so very far
         away, that their distances are impossible to gauge just by
         looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate, you
         only need to know the *direction* toward the object to locate
         it in the sky. In this sense, the celestial sphere model is a
         very practical model for mapping the sky.

         The directions toward various objects in the sky can be
         quantified by constructing a :doc:`Celestial Coordinate
         System  <ai-skycoords>`.
