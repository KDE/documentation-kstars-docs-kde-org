   |Developer Window|

 The ``Developer`` page provides a few checkboxes that can help
 debug issues with KStars. There are checkboxes for saving
 images in logging directories that might help debug issues. Of
 course, saving images can take up disk space and should be used
 judiciously.

 The images that can be saved are

    -  all focus images,

    -  all guider images,

    -  all align images, and

    -  align images where the plate-solving failed.

 The images are all saved in folders parallel to the main
 logging directory. They are in folders named guide, autofocus,
 align, and align/failed.
