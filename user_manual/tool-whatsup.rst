What's up Tonight? Tool
=======================

               |What's up Tonight?|

         The “What's up Tonight?” (WUT) tool displays a list of objects
         that will be visible at night from any location, on any date.
         By default, the Date and Location are taken from the current
         settings in the main window, but you can change either value
         using the ``Change Date...`` and ``Change Location...`` buttons at the
         top of the WUT window.

         The WUT tool also displays a short almanac of data for the
         selected date: the rise and set times for the Sun and moon, the
         duration of the night, and the Moon's illumination fraction.

         Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed.
         The objects are organized into type categories. Select an
         object type in the box labeled ``Select a category:``, and all
         objects of that type which are above the horizon on the
         selected night will be displayed in the box labeled ``Matching
         objects:``. For example, in the screenshot, the ``Planets`` category
         has been selected, and three planets which are up on the
         selected night are displayed (Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). When
         an object in the list is selected, its rise, set and transit
         times are displayed in the lower-right panel (i.e. Mars rises
         at 17:13, transits at 21:46 and sets at 02:16). In addition,
         you can press the ``Object Details...`` button to open the :ref:`Object
         Details window <tools-object-details-window>` for that object.

         By default, the WUT will display objects which are above the
         horizon between sunset and midnight (i.e. “in the evening”).
         You can choose to show objects which are up between midnight
         and dawn (“in the morning”), or between dusk and dawn (“any
         time tonight”) using the combobox near the top of the window.
         You can also choose to see only those objects that are brighter
         than a magnitude by setting a minimum magnitude using the ``Show
         objects brighter than magnitude:`` spinbox. You may center the
         selected object in the Sky Map or add it to Wish List by
         pressing the ``Center Object`` or ``Add to List`` button.
