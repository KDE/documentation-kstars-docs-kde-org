Cosmic Distance Ladder
======================

         **Akarsh Simha**

         The cosmic distance ladder refers to the succession of
         different methods that astronomers use to measure distances to
         objects in the sky. Some methods, like
         :doc:`parallax  <ai-parallax>`, work well for only nearby
         objects. Other methods, like using the *cosmological redshift*,
         work only for very distance galaxies. Thus, there are several
         methods, each with its own limited validity, and hence the
         name.

Direct measurements
====================

            The bottom of the ladder consists of objects whose distances
            can be directly measured, like the moon (see `Lunar Laser
            Ranging <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment>`__).
            The same technique, using radio waves, is applied to find
            distances to planets as well.

            For nearby stars, measuring the
            :doc:`parallax  <ai-parallax>` is possible and yields the
            distance to the star.

.. _ai-cosmicdist-standard-candles:

Standard candles
=================

            "Standard candles" are objects whose intrinsic brightnesses
            we can know for sure. The apparent
            :doc:`magnitude  <ai-magnitude>`, which is easy to measure,
            tells us how bright an object appears, not how bright it
            actually is. Distant objects appear less brighter, because
            their light gets spread out over a larger area.

            In accordance with the *inverse square law* for light
            intensities, the amount of light we receive from an object
            drops with the distance squared. Thus, we may compute the
            distance to an object if we know both how bright it actually
            is (absolute magnitude; 'M') and how bright it appears to us
            on earth (apparent magnitude; 'm'). We may define the
            *distance modulus* as follows:

            Distance Modulus = M - m = 5 log\ :sub:`10` d - 5

            Here 'd' is the distance measured in
            :doc:`parsecs  <ai-parallax>`.

            For these special standard candle objects, we have some
            other way of knowing their intrinsic brightness, and thereby
            can calculate their distance.

            Common "standard candles" used in astronomy are:
               -  Cepheid Variables: A kind of periodic variable star,
                  whose variation period is related to the luminosity

               -  RR Lyrae Variables: Another such periodic variable
                  star with a well-known period-luminosity relationship

               -  Type-Ia supernovae: These supernovae have a very
                  well-defined luminosity as a result of the physics
                  that governs them and hence serve as standard-candles

.. _ai-cosmicdist-other-methods:

Other methods
==============

            There are many other methods. Some of them rely on the
            physics of stars, such as the relationship between
            luminosity and color for various types of stars (this is
            usually represented on a *Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram*). Some
            of them work for star clusters, such as the *Moving cluster
            method* and the *main-sequence fitting method*. The
            *Tully-Fisher relation* that relates the brightness of a
            spiral galaxy to its rotation can be used to find the
            distance modulus, since the rotation of a galaxy is easy to
            measure using *Doppler shift*. Distances to distant galaxies
            may be found by measuring the *Cosmological redshift*, which
            is the redshift of light from distance galaxies that results
            from the expansion of the universe.
