Ekos Setup
=============

|Ekos Summary|

**Ekos** is a part of `KStars <https://edu.kde.org/kstars>`__. KStars/Ekos is already included with your StellarMate gadget. It is also `available for Linux®, Mac® OS, and Windows® <https://www.stellarmate.com/component/jdownloads/category/2-ekos.html?Itemid=507>`__ if you want to install on your primary machine. After you run KStars on your PC or on StellarMate (Either directly via HDMI or via :ref:`VNC  <ekos_tutorials_viewer>`), Ekos can be accessed from the ``Tools`` menu or via the ``Ekos`` on the main toolbar, or by a keyboard shortcut (**Ctrl** + **K**). In addition to the Ekos window, KStars provides a more detailed INDI Control Panel where you can directly set and control the device parameters.

When running Ekos, it is *not* necessary to start INDI Server via StellarMate Web Manager as Ekos manages that transparently.
