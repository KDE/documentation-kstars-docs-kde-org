This concludes the tour of the KStars skymap, although we have
only scratched the surface of the available features. KStars
includes many useful :doc:`astronomy tools  <tools>`, it can
directly :doc:`control your telescope  <indi>`, and it offers
a wide variety of :doc:`configuration and customization

the :doc:`AstroInfo Project  <astroinfo>`, a series of short,

astrophysical concepts behind KStars.
