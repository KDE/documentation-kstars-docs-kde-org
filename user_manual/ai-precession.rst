Precession

         *Precession* is the gradual change in the direction of the
         Earth's spin axis. The spin axis traces a cone, completing a
         full circuit in 26,000 years. If you have ever spun a top or a
         dreidel, the “wobbling” rotation of the top as it spins is
         precession.

         Because the direction of the Earth's spin axis changes, so does
         the location of the :doc:`Celestial Poles  <ai-cpoles>`.

         The reason for the Earth's precession is complicated. The Earth
         is not a perfect sphere, it is a bit flattened, meaning the
         :doc:`Great Circle  <ai-greatcircle>` of the equator is longer
         than a “meridonal” great circle that passes through the poles.
         Also, the Moon and Sun lie outside the Earth's Equatorial
         plane. As a result, the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun
         on the oblate Earth induces a slight *torque* in addition to a
         linear force. This torque on the spinning body of the Earth
         leads to the precessional motion.

         .. tip::

            Exercise:

            Precession is easiest to see by observing the :doc:`Celestial
            Pole  <ai-cpoles>`. To find the pole, first switch to
            Equatorial Coordinates in the ``Configure - KStars`` window, and
            then hold down the **Up** arrow key until the display stops
            scrolling. The declination displayed in the center of the
            Info Panel should be +90 degrees, and the bright star
            Polaris should be nearly at the center of the screen. Try
            slewing with the left and right arrow keys. Notice that the
            sky appears to rotate around the Pole.

            We will now demonstrate Precession by changing the Date to a
            very remote year, and observing that the location of the
            Celestial Pole is no longer near Polaris. Open the ``Set Time``
            window (**Ctrl**\ +\ **S**), and set the date to the year
            8000 (currently, KStars cannot handle dates much more remote
            than this, but this date is sufficient for our purposes).
            Notice that the sky display is now centered at a point
            between the constellations Cygnus and Cepheus. Verify that
            this is actually the pole by slewing left and right: the sky
            rotates about this point; in the year 8000, the North
            celestial pole will no longer be near Polaris.
