    |Guides Window|

The ``Guides`` page lets you toggle whether non-objects are displayed (i.e., constellation lines, constellation names, the Milky Way contour, the :doc:`celestial equator  <ai-cequator>`, :doc:`the ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`, :doc:`the horizon line  <ai-horizon>`, and the opaque ground). You can also choose a sky culture, whether you would like to see Latin constellation names, IAU-standard three-letter abbreviations, or constellation names using your local language.
