The Zenith
==========

         **Jason Harris**

         The Zenith is the point in the sky where you are looking when
         you look “straight up” from the ground. More precisely, it is
         the point on the sky with an *Altitude* of +90 Degrees; it is
         the Pole of the :ref:`Horizontal Coordinate
         System <ai-skycoords-horizontal>`. Geometrically, it is
         the point on the :doc:`Celestial Sphere  <ai-csphere>`
         intersected by a line drawn from the center of the Earth
         through your location on the Earth's surface.

         The Zenith is, by definition, a point along the :doc:`Local
         Meridian  <ai-meridian>`.

         .. tip::
