The Equinoxes

         Most people know the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes as calendar
         dates, signifying the beginning of the Northern hemisphere's
         Spring and Autumn, respectively. Did you know that the
         equinoxes are also positions in the sky?

         The :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` and the
         :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>` are two :doc:`Great
         Circles  <ai-greatcircle>` on the :doc:`Celestial
         Sphere  <ai-csphere>`, set at an angle of 23.5 degrees.
         The two points where they intersect are called the *Equinoxes*.
         The *Vernal Equinox* has coordinates RA=0.0 hours, Dec=0.0
         degrees. The *Autumnal Equinox* has coordinates RA=12.0 hours,
         Dec=0.0 degrees.

         The Equinoxes are important for marking the seasons. Because
         they are on the :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`, the Sun passes
         through each equinox every year. When the Sun passes through
         the Vernal Equinox (usually on March 21st), it crosses the
         :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` from South to North,
         signifying the end of Winter for the Northern hemisphere.
         Similarly, when the Sun passes through the Autumnal Equinox
         (usually on September 21st), it crosses the Celestial Equator
         from North to South, signifying the end of Winter for the
         Southern hemisphere.
