Chapter 6. FITS Viewer
======================


         FITS, or Flexible Image Transport System, is the standard
         format for representing images and data in Astronomy. The
         KStars FITS Viewer is a tool to view those images. It is not
         designed for editing of FITS Images.

         The FITS Viewer can be automatically invoked for images
         received from the camera. It can also be invoked directly from
         the main KStars menu. To open a FITS file, select the ``File`` →
         ``Open Image...`` menu item, or press **Ctrl**\ +\ **O**.

         The above diagram illustrates the FITS Viewer main work area
         and window. There is also a hidden area that can be exposed by
         moving the mouse over the 6 small dots on the left side (about
         center of the image vertically) and pressing and holding the
         mouse, sliding it over to the right a bit.
