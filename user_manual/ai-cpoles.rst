===================
The Celestial Poles
===================

         **Jason Harris**

         The sky appears to drift overhead from east to west, completing
         a full circuit around the sky in 24
         (:doc:`Sidereal <ai-sidereal>`) hours. This phenomenon is due
         to the spinning of the Earth on its axis. The Earth's spin axis
         intersects the :doc:`Celestial Sphere <ai-csphere>` at two
         points. These points are the *Celestial Poles*. As the Earth
         spins; they remain fixed in the sky, and all other points seem
         to rotate around them. The celestial poles are also the poles
         of the :ref:`Equatorial Coordinate
         System <ai-skycoords-equatorial>`, meaning they have
         *Declinations* of +90 degrees and -90 degrees (for the North
         and South celestial poles, respectively).

         The North Celestial Pole currently has nearly the same
         coordinates as the bright star *Polaris* (which is Latin for
         “Pole Star”). This makes Polaris useful for navigation: not
         only is it always above the North point of the horizon, but its
         :ref:`Altitude <ai-skycoords-horizontal>` angle is always
         (nearly) equal to the observer's :doc:`Geographic
         Latitude <ai-geocoords>` (however, Polaris can only be
         seen from locations in the Northern hemisphere).

         The fact that Polaris is near the pole is purely a coincidence.
         In fact, because of :doc:`Precession <ai-precession>`,
         Polaris is only near the pole for a small fraction of the time.

            Exercises:

            Use the ``Find Object`` window (**Ctrl**\ +\ **F**) to locate
            Polaris. Notice that its Declination is almost (but not
            exactly) +90 degrees. Compare the Altitude reading when
            focused on Polaris to your location's geographic latitude.
            They are always within one degree of each other. They are
            not exactly the same because Polaris isn't exactly at the
            Pole. (you can point exactly at the pole by switching to
            Equatorial coordinates, and pressing the up-arrow key until
            the sky stops scrolling).

            Use the ``Time Step`` spinbox in the toolbar to accelerate time
            to a step of 100 seconds. You can see the entire sky appears
            to rotate around Polaris, while Polaris itself remains
            nearly stationary.

            We said that the celestial pole is the pole of the
            Equatorial coordinate system. What do you think is the pole
            of the horizontal (Altitude/Azimuth) coordinate system? (The
            :doc:`Zenith <ai-zenith>`).
