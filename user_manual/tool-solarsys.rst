Solar System Viewer

               |Solar System Viewer|

         This tool displays a model of our solar system as seen from
         above. The Sun is drawn as a yellow dot in the center of the
         plot, and the orbits of the planets are drawn as ellipses with
         the correct shapes and orientations. The current position of
         each planet along its orbit is drawn as a colored dot, along
         with a name label. The display can be zoomed in and out with
         the **+** and **-** keys, and the display can be recentered
         with the arrow keys, or by double-clicking anywhere in the
         window with the mouse. You can also center on a planet with the
         **0**â€“**9** keys (**0** is the Sun; **9** is Pluto). If you
         center on a planet, it will be tracked as time passes in the
         tool.

         The Solar System Viewer has its own clock, independent of the
         clock in the main KStars window. There is a timestep control
         widget here, similar to the one in the main window's toolbar.
         However, this control defaults to a timestep of 1 day (so that
         the motions of the planets can be seen), and it starts out with
         the clock paused when the tool is opened. You may set the date
         to now by pressing the ``Today`` button.

         .. note::

            The current model used for Pluto's orbit is only good for
            dates within about 100 years of the present date. If you let
            the Solar System clock advance beyond this range, you will
            see Pluto behave very strangely! We are aware of this issue,
            and will try to improve Pluto's orbit model soon.
