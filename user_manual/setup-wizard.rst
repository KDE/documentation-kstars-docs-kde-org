The Setup Wizard
=================

The first time you run KStars, you will be presented with a Setup Wizard, which allows you to easily set your geographic location and download some extra data files. You can press the ``OK`` button at any time to exit the Setup Wizard.

The second page of the Setup Wizard allows you to choose the starting geographic location, by selecting from the list of the 3400+ known locations on the right side of the window.  The list of locations can be filtered to match the text you enter in the ``City filter:``, ``Province filter:``, and ``Country filter:`` edit boxes. If your desired location is not present in the list, you can select a nearby city instead for now.  Later on, you can add your precise location manually using the :doc:`Set Geographic Location tool  <config-setgeo>`.  Once you have selected a starting location, press the ``Next`` button.

The last page of the Setup Wizard allows you to download extra data that are not included with the standard distribution of KStars. Simply press the ``Download Extra Data...`` button to open the ``Get New Stuff`` tool. When you are all done, press the ``OK`` button in the Setup Wizard to start exploring KStars.
