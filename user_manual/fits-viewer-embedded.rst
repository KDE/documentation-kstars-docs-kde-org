Embedded FITS Viewer
====================

|FITS Viewer embedded|

In Ekos :doc:`Focus <ekos-focus>`, :doc:`Guide <ekos-guide>`, and :doc:`Align <ekos-align>` modules, captured images are displayed in the embedded FITS Viewer. The embedded viewer includes a *floating bar* that can be used to perform several functions:

    -  Zoom Out

    -  Zoom In

    -  Default Zoom

    -  Zoom To Fit

    -  Toggle Cross Hairs

    -  Toggle Pixel Gridlines

    -  Toggle Detected Stars: Highlight detected stars with red
       circles.

    -  Star Profile: View detailed 3D star profile.

The floating bar is automatically hidden once the mouse leaves the embedded viewer area. You can use the mouse to pan and zoom just like the standalone FITS Viewer. The green tracking box can be used to select a specific star or region within the image, for example, to select a guide star.
