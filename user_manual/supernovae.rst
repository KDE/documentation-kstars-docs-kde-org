               |Supernovae Window|

The ``Supernovae`` page allows you to decide if the supernovae are displayed or not by checking the ``Show supernovae`` checkbox. By default, supernovae are drawn as small light orange “+” mark.  As for satellites, the color of supernovae can be easily customized using the ``Colors`` page.

You can set the magnitude limit for showing a supernova as well as magnitude limit for supernova alerts using the spin boxes control. The limiting magnitude is the faintest apparent magnitude of an skyobject that is visible with the naked-eye or a telescope.

The list of recent supernovae can be updated via the ``Data`` → ``Updates`` → ``Update Recent Supernovae data`` menu item.
