"The Ekos Scheduler is an important component of your imaging workflow. It "

"jobs according to their constraints and priorities, monitors those jobs as "
"they execute, and then safely brings down the system when jobs are done, or "
"before dawn. Whether you are running multi-day imaging sessions for multiple "
