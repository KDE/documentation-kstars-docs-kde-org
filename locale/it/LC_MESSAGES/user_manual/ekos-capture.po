"exposures will contain a high amount of noise relative to their exposure "

"The value of image stacking is that as images are stacked, the accumulation "
"of exposure time and the data that represents the target signal is increased "
"proportionally with the added number of images being integrated, but the "
"increase in noise is disproportionally lower. As a result, the quality of "
"integrated images can be seen as curve which starts with a good ‚Äúyield‚Äù when "
"the first few sub-exposures are integrated, but this curve has diminishing "

"Ideally a desired signal to noise ratio (SNR) would be used for the measure "
"of the level of quality of an image, but the exposure calculator does not "
"possess an ability to recognize the strength of the signal from an intended "
"imaging target, so it cannot calculate an estimated signal to noise ratio. "
"So the level of quality to be specified in the stacking calculation is the "
"integration time in seconds divided by the calculated noise in the "
"integrated image, (a ‚ÄúTime/Noise Ratio‚Äù). For the purposes of the "
"calculation, the ‚ÄúTime/Noise Ratio‚Äù can be considered as a partial analog to "
"a signal to noise ratio. But the user must recognize that a specified time "
"to noise ratio is not an absolute measure of the quality of all integrated "
"images from all targets because a signal strength (magnitude or flux) is not "
"part of this calculation."
