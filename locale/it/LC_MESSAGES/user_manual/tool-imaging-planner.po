"The Imaging Planner tool assists users in selecting objects to image. Users "
"can download catalogs of recommended objects, and may create and share their "
"own catalogs. The tool calculates when objects in a catalog may be imaged on "
"the selected night, given constraints such as minimum altitude, terrain, and "
"moon elevation and separation. It can sort the objects along several "
"dimensions including the number of hours an object may be imaged tonight "
"(given the user's geography, constraints and possibly artificial horizon), "
"the object's peak altitude, distance from the moon, constellation, name, and "
"type. Objects can also be filtered out for several reasons (e.g., object "
"type, whether it was previously imaged, keywords, whether the object has "
"been selected, or if the user is uninterested). This tool aids object "
"selection by displaying high-quality images, showing sky locations on the "
"skymap, and providing links to follow to internet sites with more "
"information and images. It allows attaching notes and links to objects, and "
"selecting them for future consideration. This tool can be used with Ekos or "
"other imaging tools, but does not directly interact with the imager; it "
"helps the user decide what to image."
