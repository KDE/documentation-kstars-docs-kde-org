"The Equinoxes are important for marking the seasons. Because they are on the"
" :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`, the Sun passes through each equinox every "
"year. When the Sun passes through the Vernal Equinox (usually on March "
"21st), it crosses the :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` from South to "
"North, signifying the end of Winter for the Northern hemisphere. Similarly, "
"when the Sun passes through the Autumnal Equinox (usually on September "
"21st), it crosses the Celestial Equator from North to South, signifying the "
"end of Winter for the Southern hemisphere."
