"The ``Satellites`` page allows you to set the satellites view options. "
"Firstly, you can see or hide the satellites on the skymap using ``Show "
"satellites`` checkbox from the top ``View Options`` section. By default, "
"satellites are drawn as small light red filled circles with an optional dark"
" red name label next to them. You can enable or disable these labels by "
"checking or not the ``Show labels`` checkbox. It is located below the ``Show"
" satellites`` checkbox, within the ``View Options`` section."

"The colors of the dots representing satellites and their name labels can be "
"easily customized using the ``Colors`` page from the same ``Configure - "
"KStars`` window. In addition, satellites can be drawn just like regular "
"stars by checking the ``Draw satellites`` like stars checkbox. To display "
"only the visible satellites from your current geographic location and time, "
"select ``Show only visible satellites``."

"KStars can draw artificial satellites from many predefined groups. Thus, you"
" can select to display a particular group, multiple groups or partially "
"select subgroups. Under each group, a list of individual satellites is "
"presented. To select all satellites from a group, you need to check the "
"group checkbox. You can also select only the satellites of interest in each "
"group. The satellites orbital elements can be updated via the internet by "
"pressing the ``Update TLEs`` button. Another way for updating the satellites"
" orbital elements is to use the ``Data`` → ``Updates`` → ``Update Satellites"
" Orbital Elements`` menu item. If you know the name of a desired satellite "
"then you can use the search satellites method that KStars provides. You need"
" to enter the name of satellite in the ``Search satellites`` text box and "
"the list will be reduced only to its best matches."

"You can add new satellites to KStars default satellites set by editing the "
"``kstars/data/satellites.dat`` file. As each line of this file is a group of"
" satellites, you need to add a new entry for your desired satellites group. "
"An entry should have the following format: **Group "
"Name;local_filename;url**. For example: "
"**Iridium;iridium.tle;https://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/iridium.txt**."
