"The main key concept in INDI is that devices have the ability to describe "
"themselves. This is accomplished by using XML to describe a generic "
"hierarchy that can represent both canonical and non-canonical devices. In "
"INDI, all *devices* may contain one or more *properties*. Any *property* may"
" contain one or more *elements*. There are four types of INDI properties:"

"For example, all INDI devices share the CONNECTION standard switch "
"*property*. The CONNECTION property has two elements: CONNECT and DISCONNECT"
" switches. KStars parses the generic XML description of properties and "

"The INDI control panel offers many device properties not accessible from the"

"Nevertheless, all properties share common features that constrains how they "
"are displayed and used:"

"Permission: All properties can either be read-only, write-only, or read and "
"write enabled. An example of a read-write property is the telescope's Right "
"Ascension. You can enter a new Right Ascension and the telescope, based on "
"current settings, will either slew or sync to the new input. Furthermore, "
"when the telescope slews, its Right Ascension gets updated and sent back to "
"the client."
