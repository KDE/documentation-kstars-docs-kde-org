"*Sidereal Time* literally means “star time”. The time we are used to using "
"in our everyday lives is Solar Time. The fundamental unit of Solar Time is a"
" *Day*: the time it takes the Sun to travel 360 degrees around the sky, due "
"to the rotation of the Earth. Smaller units of Solar Time are just divisions"
" of a Day:"

"However, there is a problem with Solar Time. The Earth does not actually "
"spin around 360 degrees in one Solar Day. The Earth is in orbit around the "
"Sun, and over the course of one day, it moves about one Degree along its "
"orbit (360 degrees/365.25 Days for a full orbit = about one Degree per Day)."
" So, in 24 hours, the direction toward the Sun changes by about a Degree. "
"Therefore, the Earth has to spin 361 degrees to make the Sun look like it "
"has traveled 360 degrees around the Sky."

"In astronomy, we are concerned with how long it takes the Earth to spin with"
" respect to the “fixed” stars, not the Sun. So, we would like a timescale "
"that removes the complication of Earth's orbit around the Sun, and just "
"focuses on how long it takes the Earth to spin 360 degrees with respect to "
"the stars. This rotational period is called a *Sidereal Day*. On average, it"
" is 4 minutes shorter than a Solar Day, because of the extra 1 degree the "
"Earth spins in a Solar Day. Rather than defining a Sidereal Day to be 23 "
"hours, 56 minutes, we define Sidereal Hours, Minutes and Seconds that are "
"the same fraction of a Day as their Solar counterparts. Therefore, one Solar"
" Second = 1.00278 Sidereal Seconds."

"The Sidereal Time is useful for determining where the stars are at any given"
" time. Sidereal Time divides one full spin of the Earth into 24 Sidereal "
"Hours; similarly, the map of the sky is divided into 24 Hours of *Right "
"Ascension*. This is no coincidence; Local Sidereal Time (LST) indicates the "
"Right Ascension on the sky that is currently crossing the :doc:`Local "
"Meridian  <ai-meridian>`. So, if a star has a Right Ascension of 05h 32m "
"24s, it will be on your meridian at LST=05:32:24. More generally, the "
"difference between an object's RA and the Local Sidereal Time tells you how "
"far from the Meridian the object is. For example, the same object at "
"LST=06:32:24 (one Sidereal Hour later), will be one Hour of Right Ascension "
"west of your meridian, which is 15 degrees. This angular distance from the "
"meridian is called the object's :doc:`Hour Angle  <ai-hourangle>`."

"The Local Sidereal Time is displayed by KStars in the ``Time Info`` Box, "
"with the label “ST” (you have to “unshade” the box by double-clicking it in "
"order to see the sidereal time). Note that the changing sidereal seconds are"
" not synchronized with the changing Local Time and Universal Time seconds. "
"In fact, if you watch the clocks for a while, you will notice that the "
"Sidereal seconds really are slightly shorter than the LT and UT seconds."

"Point to the :doc:`Zenith  <ai-zenith>` (press **Z** or select the "
"``Pointing`` → ``Zenith`` menu item). The Zenith is the point on the sky "
"where you are looking “straight up” from the ground, and it is a point on "
"your :doc:`Local Meridian  <ai-meridian>`. Note the Right Ascension of the "
"Zenith: it is exactly the same as your Local Sidereal Time."
