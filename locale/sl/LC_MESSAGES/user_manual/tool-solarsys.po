"This tool displays a model of our solar system as seen from above. The Sun "
"is drawn as a yellow dot in the center of the plot, and the orbits of the "
"planets are drawn as ellipses with the correct shapes and orientations. The "
"current position of each planet along its orbit is drawn as a colored dot, "
"along with a name label. The display can be zoomed in and out with the **+**"
" and **-** keys, and the display can be recentered with the arrow keys, or "
"by double-clicking anywhere in the window with the mouse. You can also "
"center on a planet with the **0**â€“**9** keys (**0** is the Sun; **9** is "
"Pluto). If you center on a planet, it will be tracked as time passes in the "
"tool."

"The Solar System Viewer has its own clock, independent of the clock in the "
"main KStars window. There is a timestep control widget here, similar to the "
"one in the main window's toolbar. However, this control defaults to a "
"timestep of 1 day (so that the motions of the planets can be seen), and it "
"starts out with the clock paused when the tool is opened. You may set the "
"date to now by pressing the ``Today`` button."

"The current model used for Pluto's orbit is only good for dates within about"
" 100 years of the present date. If you let the Solar System clock advance "
"beyond this range, you will see Pluto behave very strangely! We are aware of"
" this issue, and will try to improve Pluto's orbit model soon."
