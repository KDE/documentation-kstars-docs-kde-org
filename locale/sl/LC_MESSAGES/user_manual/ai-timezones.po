"The Earth is round, and it is always half-illuminated by the Sun. However, "
"because the Earth is spinning, the half that is illuminated is always "
"changing. We experience this as the passing of days wherever we are on the "
"Earth's surface. At any given instant, there are places on the Earth passing"
" from the dark half into the illuminated half (which is seen as *dawn* on "
"the surface). At the same instant, on the opposite side of the Earth, points"
" are passing from the illuminated half into darkness (which is seen as "
"*dusk* at those locations). So, at any given time, different places on Earth"
" are experiencing different parts of the day. Thus, Solar time is defined "
"locally, so that the clock time at any location describes the part of the "
"day consistently."

"This localization of time is accomplished by dividing the globe into 24 "
"vertical slices called *Time Zones*. The Local Time is the same within any "
"given zone, but the time in each zone is one Hour *earlier* than the time in"
" the neighboring Zone to the East. Actually, this is an idealized "
"simplification; real Time Zone boundaries are not straight vertical lines, "
"because they often follow national boundaries and other political "
"considerations."

"Note that because the Local Time always increases by an hour when moving "
"between Zones to the East, by the time you move through all 24 Time Zones, "
"you are a full day ahead of where you started. We deal with this paradox by "
"defining the *International Date Line*, which is a Time Zone boundary in the"
" Pacific Ocean, between Asia and North America. Points just to the East of "
"this line are 24 hours behind the points just to the West of the line. This "
"leads to some interesting phenomena. A direct flight from Australia to "
"California arrives before it departs. Also, the islands of Fiji straddle the"
" International Date Line, so if you have a bad day on the West side of Fiji,"
" you can go over to the East side of Fiji and have a chance to live the same"
" day all over again."
