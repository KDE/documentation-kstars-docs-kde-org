"2500 years ago, the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus classified the "
"brightnesses of visible stars in the sky on a scale from 1 to 6. He called "
"the very brightest stars in the sky “first magnitude”, and the very faintest"
" stars he could see “sixth magnitude”. Amazingly, two and a half millenia "
"later, Hipparchus's classification scheme is still widely used by "
"astronomers, although it has since been modernized and quantified."

"The magnitude scale runs backwards to what you might expect: brighter stars "

"If you do not understand the math, this just says that the magnitude of a "
"given star (m) is different from that of some standard star (m\\ :sub:`0`) "
"by 2.5 times the logarithm of their flux ratio. The 2.5 \\*log factor means "
"that if the flux ratio is 100, the difference in magnitudes is 5 mag. So, a "
"6th magnitude star is 100 times fainter than a 1st magnitude star. The "
"reason Hipparchus's simple classification translates to a relatively complex"
" function is that the human eye responds logarithmically to light."

"There are several different magnitude scales in use, each of which serves a "
"different purpose. The most common is the apparent magnitude scale; this is "
"just the measure of how bright stars (and other objects) look to the human "
"eye. The apparent magnitude scale defines the star Vega to have magnitude "
"0.0, and assigns magnitudes to all other objects using the above equation, "
"and a measure of the flux ratio of each object to Vega."

"It is difficult to understand stars using just the apparent magnitudes. "
"Imagine two stars in the sky with the same apparent magnitude, so they "
"appear to be equally bright. You cannot know just by looking if the two have"
" the same *intrinsic* brightness; it is possible that one star is "
"intrinsically brighter, but further away. If we knew the distances to the "
"stars (see the :doc:`parallax  <ai-parallax>` article), we could account for"
" their distances and assign *Absolute magnitudes* which would reflect their "
"true, intrinsic brightness. The absolute magnitude is defined as the "
"apparent magnitude the star would have if observed from a distance of 10 "
"parsecs (1 parsec is 3.26 light-years, or 3.1 x 10\\ :sup:`18` cm). The "
"absolute magnitude (M) can be determined from the apparent magnitude (m) and"
" the distance in parsecs (d) using the formula:"

"The modern magnitude scale is no longer based on the human eye; it is based "
"on photographic plates and photoelectric photometers. With telescopes, we "
"can see objects much fainter than Hipparchus could see with his unaided "
"eyes, so the magnitude scale has been extended beyond 6th magnitude. In "
"fact, the Hubble Space Telescope can image stars nearly as faint as 30th "
"magnitude, which is one *trillion* times fainter than Vega."

"A final note: the magnitude is usually measured through a color filter of "
"some kind, and these magnitudes are denoted by a subscript describing the "
"filter (i.e., m\\ :sub:`V` is the magnitude through a “visual” filter, which"
" is greenish; m\\ :sub:`B` is the magnitude through a blue filter; m\\ "
":sub:`pg` is the photographic plate magnitude, etc.)."
