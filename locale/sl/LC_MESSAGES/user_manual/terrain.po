"The user is responsible for creating a partially-transparent image, that is "
"overlayed onto the sky map. This image should have transparent regions that "
"the user creates to let the skymap show through, and opaque regions "
"representing the trees, buildings, the landscape around the telescope. There"
" is a particular format required, and this is a significant effort.  There "
"are many resources on the web that explain how this is done for `Stellarium "
"<https://stellarium.org/landscapes.html>`__. The details of image creation "
"are the same."

"Initially, the user captures a full sphere equirectangular projection image "
"from approximately the same point-of-view as his/her telescope. This kind of"
" image can be captured with the Google Camera App, or the Google YouTube App"
" on iPhone, or likely many other camera apps. The user then needs to edit "
"the resulting image so that the sky is erased/transparent, and save it as a "
"PNG. Finally, the user needs to determine where North is in the image, so it"
" can eventually be aligned with the skymap. Once all that is done, the sky "
"map can simulate the local sky view including the local terrain."

"Once the image is created, it is possible to upload it via the ``Terrain`` "
"page and configure the azimuth correction value (in degrees) that allows the"
" user to rotate the view so north in the sky map is aligned with the north "
"in the image."
