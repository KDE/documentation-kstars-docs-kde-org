"Spiral galaxies are huge collections of billions of stars, most of which are"
" flattened into a disk shape, with a bright, spherical bulge of stars at its"
" center. Within the disk, there are typically bright arms where the "
"youngest, brightest stars are found. These arms wind out from the center in "
"a spiral pattern, giving the galaxies their name. Spiral galaxies look a bit"
" like hurricanes, or like water flowing down a drain. They are some of the "
"most beautiful objects in the sky."

"Galaxies are classified using a “tuning fork diagram”. The end of the fork "
"classifies :doc:`elliptical galaxies  <ai-ellipgal>` on a scale from the "
"roundest, which is an E0, to those that appear most flattened, which is "
"rated as E7. The “tines” of the tuning fork are where the two types of "
"spiral galaxies are classified: normal spirals, and “barred” spirals. A "
"barred spiral is one whose nuclear bulge is stretched out into a line, so it"
" literally looks like it has a “bar” of stars in its center."

"Both types of spiral galaxies are sub-classified according to the prominence"
" of their central “bulge” of stars, their overall surface brightness, and "
"how tightly their spiral arms are wound. These characteristics are related, "
"so that an Sa galaxy has a large central bulge, a high surface brightness, "
"and tightly-wound spiral arms. An Sb galaxy has a smaller bulge, a dimmer "
"disk, and looser arms than an Sa, and so on through Sc and Sd. Barred "
"galaxies use the same classification scheme, indicated by types SBa, SBb, "
"SBc, and SBd."

"There is another class of galaxy called S0, which is morphologically a "
"transitional type between true spirals and ellipticals. Its spiral arms are "
"so tightly wound as to be indistinguishable; S0 galaxies have disks with a "
"uniform brightness. They also have an extremely dominant bulge."

"The Milky Way galaxy, which is home to earth and all of the stars in our "
"sky, is a Spiral Galaxy, and is believed to be a barred spiral. The name "
"“Milky Way” refers to a band of very faint stars in the sky. This band is "
"the result of looking in the plane of our galaxy's disk from our perspective"
" inside it."

"Spiral galaxies are very dynamic entities. They are hotbeds of star "
"formation, and contain many young stars in their disks. Their central bulges"
" tend to be made of older stars, and their diffuse halos are made of the "
"very oldest stars in the Universe. Star formation is active in the disks "
"because that is where the gas and dust are most concentrated; gas and dust "
"are the building blocks of star formation."

"Modern telescopes have revealed that many Spiral galaxies harbor "
"supermassive black holes at their centers, with masses that can exceed that "
"of a billion Suns. Both elliptical and spiral galaxies are known to contain "
"these exotic objects; in fact many astronomers now believe that *all* large "
"galaxies contain a supermassive black hole in their nucleus. Our own Milky "
"Way is known to harbor a black hole in its core with a mass millions of "
"times bigger than a star's mass."
