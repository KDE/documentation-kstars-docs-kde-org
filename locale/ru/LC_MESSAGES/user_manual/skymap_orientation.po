"First, pick the coordinate system that matches your mount. For an "

"coordinate system should read ``Switch to Horizontal View (Horizontal "
"Coordinates)`` when the current mode is Equatorial Coordinates. For an "
"altazimuth-mounted instrument or naked-eye viewing, switch to Horizontal "
"Coordinates, so that the option in the ``View`` menu reads ``Switch to Star "
"Globe View (Equatorial Coordinates)``. This sets the base coordinate system "
"used to render the sky map, and also sets the reference for the orientation "

"Next, to rotate the sky map freely, you can hold down the **Shift** key and "

"direction of north and zenith at the point, and displaying the angle they "
"make with the vertical in a counterclockwise sense. The orientations of "
"zenith and north will update as you rotate the sky map. Letting go of "
"**Shift** or the mouse button will stop the rotation operation. As you pan "
"the sky map or focus it on different objects, the rotation you set is "
"retained as an offset from the reference direction. The reference direction "
"is north when using Equatorial Coordinates and zenith when using Horizontal "
"Coordinates. As a reminder, the reference direction is solid and brighter in "
"the temporary overlay. The temporary overlay also marks the East direction, "
"which will be clockwise from north when mirrored and counter-clockwise when "
"not mirrored. For the two common orientations of erect and inverted, the "
"rotation can be set / reset using the ``View`` → ``Skymap Orientation`` "
"submenu. Select ``North Down`` or ``Zenith Down`` as is applicable to set an "
"orientation of 180 degrees."

"If you are visually observing through an eyepiece of an instrument, you may "
"need to do some more correction. For the common case of a large Dobsonian "
"telescope (or more generally a Newtonian design mounted on an altazimuth "
"mount), an additional systematic correction is of help. This correction "
"applies because we stand erect while using the telescope irrespective of the "
"angle the telescope tube is making with the ground. So as we move the "
"telescope in altitude, an additional correction depending on the altitude of "
"the object needs to be applied to make the sky map match the view through "
"the eyepiece where the observer is standing erect. This correction is "
"enabled by choosing the appropriate \"Erect observer correction\" option in "
"the ``View`` → ``Skymap Orientation`` submenu. The correction depends on "
"which side the telescope's focuser is placed by the manufacturer. If when "
"observing just above the horizon through the eyepiece, the sky is on the "
"observer's right side (and the mirror to the left), pick the ``Erect "
"observer correction``, right-handed option. Similarly, if the sky is to the "
"left of the observer, choose the ``Erect observer correct``, ``left-handed`` "
"option. This correction only makes sense in Horizontal Coordinate mode and "
"is disabled when using equatorial coordinates."

"It is typical in visual astronomy to use at least three different "

"contained therein. The ``Arbitrary`` view is not a real view, but the option "
"that gets selected when the sky-map orientation is modified manually through "

"The ``Name`` field carries a unique name for the View. The ``Mount Type`` "
"determines whether the reference direction used for orientation will be "
"north or zenith. Typically, one would set this to the type of mount used for "
"the telescope. However, when using refractors and Schmidt-Cassegrain "
"Telescopes (SCTs) with a rotatable diagonal, the observer will have a "
"tendency to re-orient the eyepiece for comfort so that the eyepiece remains "
"at a fixed angle with respect to the zenith. For this reason, it makes sense "
"to choose ``Altazimuth`` mounting even when the telescope is actually on an "
"equatorial mount. Choose ``Equatorial`` mounting when the focuser will not "
"be re-oriented, such as when using a camera on an equatorially mounted "
"telescope. For Newtonian telescopes that invert (i.e. rotate by 180 degrees "
"but do not change the handedness) of the view, pick the ``Inverted`` option. "
"This is also the correct option for straight-through refractors and finder "
"scopes. When using a erecting prism diagonal, the prism erects the inverted "
"image by flipping it up-down. This results overall in a left-right mirrored "
"image. Thus for telescopes that use an erecting prism, pick ``Mirrored``. A "
"special kind of prism called an Amici roof prism not only erects the image "
"vertically, but it also prevents left-right mirroring of the image. Finder "
"scopes incorporating such a diagonal are normally called \"Right-Angle "
"Correct Image\" or RACI finder scopes. Such diagonals may also be used on "
"refractors and SCTs. When using such a prism that produces a correct image, "
"choose the ``Correct`` option. The ``Mirrored on the vertical axis`` option "
"is not encountered in typical astronomical instruments, but is provided for "
"completeness. Two more factors need to be considered: one is the angle of "
"the eyepiece with respect to the reference direction (north / zenith), and "
"the other is the orientation of the observer's head (and notion of the "
"vertical) which we explained when describing the erect observer correction "
"feature. These two aspects are configured using the single slider titled "
"``Eyepiece Angle``. Two illustrations below the slider show the "
"interpretation of this setting; on the left, as seen from the front as is "
"more convenient for Newtonian telescopes, and on the right as is seen from "
"the back, more convenient for refractors and Cassegrains. The observer "
"naturally stands on the side that makes it more convenient to look through "
"the eyepiece, so the erect observer correction is automatically adjusted "
"accordingly. For eyepiece angles that are less than -1 degree on the slider, "
"the ``Erect observer correction, right-handed`` option is applied. "
"Similarly, for eyepiece angles that are greater than +1 degree, the ``Erect "
"observer correction, left-handed`` is applied. At 0 degrees, no erect "
"observer correction is applied. This correction is indicated by a silhouette "
"of a person standing on the appropriate side of the telescope. In our "
"convention, most mass-manufactured Dobsonians seem to have a correction "
"around +45 degrees. Incidentally, this correction is also useful for finder "
"scopes with diagonals. One may want to explicitly disable the erect observer "
"correction even when the eyepiece angle is not zero. This is useful in case "
"the view comes from a CCD camera that does not change angle with respect to "
"the telescope body (unlike an observer's head), or if the display showing "
"KStars' sky map is mounted on the telescope body itself. In this case the "
"``Display mounted on the telescope`` option can be checked. For the opposite "
"effect, i.e. where the eyepiece angle is zero, but the observer is leaning "
"to look through the eyepiece from one of the two sides, set the eyepiece "
"angle to plus or minus 2 degrees to enable the erect observer correction; "
"the minor difference will not be noticeable. Finally, one may want "
"triggering of the view to also set the field-of-view of the sky map to some "
"value, for example to set the FOV of a finder scope. In this case, the "
"``Also set the field of view`` check-box may be checked, and an approximate "
"field-of-view to adjust may be specified. If this is not enabled, the zoom "
"level of the sky map is not altered when this view is applied."
