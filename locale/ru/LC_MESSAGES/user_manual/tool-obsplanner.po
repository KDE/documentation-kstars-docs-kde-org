"Since &kde; SC 4.4, Prakash Mohan&apos;s GSoC work has been released in "
"&kstars;. &kstars; now has an awesome observation planner to plan your "
"observation sessions. The execute session option allows you to log "
"information about objects as you observe them. Alternately, you may also "
"write a short log in the session planner itself. We wish you a lot of fun "
"planning your observations with &kstars;!"

"Another way of adding objects to your observation plan is using the newly "

"you can type many objects to add in one shot to the observation planner. Any "
"objects not in the &kstars; database already will be resolved using SIMBAD "
"Astronomical Database (provided this has been enabled in the Settings) and "
"added to the database. The entire process of adding objects is slow and may "
"take a while, and you can watch the progress in the Status Bar. Any objects "
"that could not be found are then listed in an error message, so you can "
"identify and fix the errors. Usually this may be because SIMBAD expects a "
"different way of specifying the object (&eg; Sim 147 instead of Simeis 147). "
"This new feature allows you to easily scrape data from observing lists on "
"the web &etc; and add them to your workflow in &kstars;."
