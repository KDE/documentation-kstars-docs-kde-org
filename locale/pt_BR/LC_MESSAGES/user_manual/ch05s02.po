"As its name suggests, this is where you will create and manage your "
"equipment profile, and connect to your devices. It also provides a summary "
"view where the capture progress along with the focus & guide operations is "
"displayed in a compact format to convey the most important information "
"relevant to the user. If any extensions are installed, the selection and "
"start/stop controls will be shown."

"After mastering Ekos, users are encouraged to learn how to use the Scheduler "
"module since it facilitates the complete observation process greatly. It "
"enables you to select multiple targets, specify which conditions and "
"requirements to be met, and what frames are required for capture. Afterwards "
"the scheduler intelligently calculates the best observation time for each "
"object and then proceed to control the complete observatory from startup to "
"shutdown."

"Analyze displays a high-level summary of what happened during an imaging "
"session. It shows plots and graphs describing the many captures takes during "
"a night, the focus sessions, the guiding, mount movement, meridian flips, "
"etc. Use it to get a feel of \"what happened last night\" or to see the "
"current state of the system."

"Measure the sharpness of your images in the focus module by calculating Half-"
"Flux-Radius. The lower the HFR, the sharper the image becomes. You can run "
"the focus module with or without a focuser. With an electronic focuser, you "
"can run an autofocus operation where Ekos iterates and calculates the "
"optical focus position."

"To achieve long exposure astrophotography, guiding is necessary to ensure "
"the image is locked and stabilized for the complete duration of the exposure "
"duration.  Deviations from the frame with time can lead to blurry images and "
"star trails. In the guide module, it can automatically select a suitable "
"guide star and then lock the mount to always keep that star in its position. "
"If the guide module detects any deviation from this locked position, it "
"sends correction pulses to the mount to bring it back to the original "
"position."

"Mount control can be either done via the Sky Map interactively or via the "
"Mount Control Panel in the mount module. Configure telescope properties "
"(focal length & aperture) for both your primary imaging telescope and guide "
"scope. However, it is recommended to select the telescopes in the equipment "
"profile and not change the values directly in the mount module."
