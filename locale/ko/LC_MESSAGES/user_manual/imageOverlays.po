"Image overlays are custom images (typically ``.jpg``) that are rendered onto"
" the skymap over stars and other skymap items, but below the terrain. These "
"images are added by you, the user, a sort of personal sky catalog. If "
"configured properly, these personal images can be displayed almost perfectly"
" aligned with other objects in the sky."

"The ``Image Overlays`` page lets you configure whether image overlays will "
"be shown on the skymap, and helps you add them to the system. The image at "

"some image overlays loaded."

"Each time it starts up, KStars looks for new image overlay images in a "
"special directory, parallel to the logs directory, named ``imageOverlays``. "
"On Linux this can be found in ``~/.local/share/kstars/imageOverlays``. The "
"exact location for your system can be found by clicking the ``Overlay "
"Directory`` button near the top of the ``Image Overlays`` config page shown "
"at the top of this section. To start, add your images to that directory. "
"Ideally, for performance reasons these aren't massive files, but probably "
"images with widths 1000 or 2000 should be fine. To add additional images in "
"the future, add them to the same directory and click the refresh button or "
"restart KStars. To remove overlays, remove them from the directory and click"
" the refresh button or restart KStars."

"Start KStars once you have images in the `imageOverlays` directory. If you "
"then go to the ``Image Overlays`` config page, you should see the new files "
"listed in the table. The new images will show their status as "
"``Unprocessed``. Only images whose status is ``OK`` are displayed on the "
"SkyMap. That is because KStars needs to know the sky location, size, and "
"orientation for these images before it can display them. To change the "
"status to ``OK`` you need to plate-solve the images or add the required "
"information manually--see below."

"To prepare your images for display, you need to plate-solve the images (one "
"time only). To do this, find an image in the table, click on its filename, "
"and then click ``Solve`` below the table. The ``Solve`` button's label "
"should switch to ``Cancel`` during the solve, and then when completed "
"successfully, the solved parameters are displayed in the table and the "
"status is changed to ``OK``. A successful plate-solve's information is "
"stored in the user database so that solving doesn't need to be repeated. The"
" solved image should from then on appear in its proper position in the "
"SkyMap. You can plate-solve multiple images in a single operation by "
"clicking on the first image's filename, then holding down the **Shift** key "
"and clicking on another filename. All the image files between the filenames "
"should be selected. Then clicking ``Solve`` will attempt to solve them all. "
"However, KStars will not attempt to plate-solve images whose status is "
"``OK``, it will skip those images. (If you wish to re-plate-solve images "
"with status ``OK``, then manually change their status to ``Unprocessed`` and"
" click ``Solve``). It is possible that if you select several images, a few "
"of them will not be successfully solved."

"Plate solving these images can sometimes be difficult. That is because at "
"this point the system has no information as to the scale or position to "
"look, and thus it is a blind solve. To improve your chance for success, you "
"can enter an approximate ``RA/DEC`` center sky position into the RA and DEC "
"columns for the row you are trying to solve. You can also add an image "
"scale, in arcseconds-per-pixel. You can add a default scale to the right of "
"the ``Solve`` button in the box labeled ``Default a-s/px`` so that all "
"solving attempts use this scale by default. You can also add a scale "
"directly into the table-row-column, which would override the default. You "
"can choose which StellarSolver profile the solver uses (these profiles can "
"be edited in Ekos' ``Align`` tab). Finally, you can adjust the solver's "
"``Timeout`` in seconds."

"If you have problematic images that won't solve, you can still display them "
"by manually entering the values (that the solver didn't find) into the "
"table. They are the RA, DEC, arcsecond-per-pixel, orientation angle, and "
"east-to-the-right (or West-to-the-right) settings. Once you have done that, "
"you can then change the status to ``OK`` and KStars will save these values "
"to the user database as if they had been automatically solved."

"There are a few more controls on the ``Image Overlays`` settings page. The "

"The ``Maximum image dimension``: spinbox allows you to vary the maximum "
"image dimension used for images. That is, if you place images that are, for "
"example, 5000 pixels wide into the ``imageOverlays`` directory, but this "
"input box's value is 1000, then the 5000-pixel-images will be read in, but "
"then downsampled to 1000-pixels-wide before display. This is done to reduce "
"the memory footprint and cpu usage of this feature. It would be more "
"efficient to add image files with the desired image width."

"The ``Center SkyMap on selection`` checkbox allows you to easily navigate to"
" the overlay images without directly manipulating the SkyMap. With this "
"enabled, you select a row in the overlay table (i.e., by clicking on the "
"filename field) and the skymap is moved to that image if the image's status "
"is OK. At that point you can move from one image to the next with ``Up`` and"
" ``Down`` arrow keyboard commands."
