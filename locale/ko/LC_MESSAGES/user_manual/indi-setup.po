"You can run devices by browsing the device tree, selecting a specific "
"device, and then clicking on the ``Run Service`` button. You can select the "
"operation mode, either local or server as defined above. The port number is "
"randomly generated between the range from 7624 to 10,000. To specify a port,"
" click on the port column next to the desired driver. KStars allows multiple"
" drivers to run under one INDI server, and hence one port. Select multiple "
