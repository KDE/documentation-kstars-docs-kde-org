"The Earth has two major components of motion. First, it spins on its "
"rotational axis; a full spin rotation takes one *Day* to complete. Second, "
"it orbits around the Sun; a full orbital rotation takes one *Year* to "
"complete."

"There are normally 365 days in one *calendar* year, but it turns out that a "
"*true* year (i.e., a full orbit of the Earth around the Sun; also called a "
"*tropical year*) is a little bit longer than 365 days. In other words, in "
"the time it takes the Earth to complete one orbital circuit, it completes "
"365.24219 spin rotations. Do not be too surprised by this; there is no "
"reason to expect the spin and orbital motions of the Earth to be "
"synchronized in any way. However, it does make marking calendar time a bit "
"awkward..."

"What would happen if we simply ignored the extra 0.24219 rotation at the end"
" of the year, and simply defined a calendar year to always be 365.0 days "
"long? The calendar is basically a charting of the Earth's progress around "
"the Sun. If we ignore the extra bit at the end of each year, then with every"
" passing year, the calendar date lags a little more behind the true position"
" of Earth around the Sun. In just a few decades, the dates of the solstices "
"and equinoxes will have drifted noticeably."

"In fact, it used to be that all years *were* defined to have 365.0 days, and"
" the calendar “drifted” away from the true seasons as a result. In the year "
"46 BCE, Julius Caeser established the *Julian Calendar*, which implemented "
"the world's first *leap years*: He decreed that every 4th year would be 366 "
"days long, so that a year was 365.25 days long, on average. This basically "
"solved the calendar drift problem."

"However, the problem wasn't completely solved by the Julian calendar, "
"because a tropical year isn't 365.25 days long; it's 365.24219 days long. "
"You still have a calendar drift problem, it just takes many centuries to "
"become noticeable. And so, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the "
"*Gregorian calendar*, which was largely the same as the Julian Calendar, "
"with one more trick added for leap years: even Century years (those ending "
"with the digits “00”) are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. So, "
"the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years (though they would have "
"been under the Julian Calendar), whereas the year 2000 *was* a leap year. "
"This change makes the average length of a year 365.2425 days. So, there is "
"still a tiny calendar drift, but it amounts to an error of only 3 days in "
"10,000 years. The Gregorian calendar is still used as a standard calendar "
"throughout most of the world."

"Fun Trivia: When Pope Gregory instituted the Gregorian Calendar, the Julian "
"Calendar had been followed for over 1500 years, and so the calendar date had"
" already drifted by over a week. Pope Gregory re-synchronized the calendar "
"by simply *eliminating* 10 days: in 1582, the day after October 4th was "
"October 15th!"
