"The time on our clocks is essentially a measurement of the current position "
"of the Sun in the sky, which is different for places at different Longitudes"
" because the Earth is round (see :doc:`Time Zones  <ai-timezones>`)."

"However, it is sometimes necessary to define a global time, one that is the "
"same for all places on Earth. One way to do this is to pick a place on the "
"Earth, and adopt the Local Time at that place as the *Universal Time*, "
"abbreviated UT. (The name is a bit of a misnomer, since Universal Time has "
"little to do with the Universe. It would perhaps be better to think of it as"
" *global time*)."

"The geographic location chosen to represent Universal Time is Greenwich, "
"England. The choice is arbitrary and historical. Universal Time became an "
"important concept when European ships began to sail the wide open seas, far "
"from any known landmarks. A navigator could reckon the ship's longitude by "
"comparing the Local Time (as measured from the Sun's position) to the time "
"back at the home port (as kept by an accurate clock on board the ship). "
"Greenwich was home to England's Royal Observatory, which was charged with "
"keeping time very accurately, so that ships in port could re-calibrate their"
" clocks before setting sail."

"Further Reading: The history behind the construction of the first clock that"
" was accurate and stable enough to be used on ships to keep Universal Time "
"is a fascinating tale, and one told expertly in the book “Longitude”, by "
"Dava Sobel."
