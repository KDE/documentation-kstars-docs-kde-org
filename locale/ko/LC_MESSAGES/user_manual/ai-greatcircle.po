"Consider a sphere, such as the Earth, or the :doc:`Celestial Sphere  <ai-"
"csphere>`. The intersection of any plane with the sphere will result in a "
"circle on the surface of the sphere. If the plane happens to contain the "
"center of the sphere, the intersection circle is a *Great Circle*. Great "
"circles are the largest circles that can be drawn on a sphere. Also, the "
"shortest path between any two points on a sphere is always along a great "
"circle."
