msgid "What is INDI?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"INDI is the `Instrument-Neutral-Distributed-Interface "
"<https://indilib.org>`__ control protocol developed by **Elwood C. Downey** "
"of `ClearSky Institute <https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/>`__. KStars "
"employs device drivers that are compatible with the INDI protocol. INDI has "
"many advantages including loose coupling between hardware devices and "
"software drivers. Clients that use the device drivers (like KStars) are "
"completely unaware of the device capabilities. In run time, KStars "
"communicates with the device drivers and builds a completely dynamical GUI "
"based on services provided by the device. Therefore, new device drivers can "
"be written or updated and KStars can take full advantage of them without any"
" changes on the client side."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes. We plan to support major CCD cameras and focusers and extend support "
"for more telescopes. If you would like INDI to support a particular device, "
"please send an email to *indi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net*"

msgid "What operations does KStars provide to control the telescope?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:26
msgid ""
"It depends on the particular telescope you're running, but the minimum three"
" operations are :command:`Slew`, :command:`Track`, and :command:`Sync`, "
"which you can issue directly from the sky map. Your telescope must be "
"aligned for those operations to perform correctly. Some telescopes offer you"
" more operations like site management, slew modes, focusing, parking, and "
"more. You can access the telescopes extended features from the ``Tools`` → "
"``Devices`` → ``INDI Control Panel...`` menu item."

"What's the difference between :command:`Slew`, :command:`Track`, and "
":command:`Sync` exactly?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"The command :command:`Slew` orders the telescope to move to a particular "
"target, and once the telescope reaches its target, the telescope keeps "
"tracking that target at a *sidereal* rate (i.e., the rate at which stars "
"move across the sky). This works well for stars, Messier objects, and about "
"everything outside our solar system. But solar system objects travel "
"differently across the sky and so the telescope must :command:`Track` the "
"objects as they move."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"Therefore, you need to issue a track command if you want to track an object "
"with non-sidereal motion. On the other hand, :command:`Sync` is used to "
"synchronize the telescope's internal coordinates with that of an object you "
"select."

msgid "Can I control my telescope remotely?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:44
msgid ""
"Yes. You can start an INDI server on the machine connected to your telescope"
" and the server will listen to requests from KStars clients. Once you're "
"connected, you can control your telescope directly from the sky map. This "
"procedure is described in detail in the :doc:`Remote device control <indi-"
"remote-control>` section."
