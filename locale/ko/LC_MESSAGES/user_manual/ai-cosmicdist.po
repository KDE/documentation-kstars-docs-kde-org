"The cosmic distance ladder refers to the succession of different methods "
"that astronomers use to measure distances to objects in the sky. Some "
"methods, like :doc:`parallax  <ai-parallax>`, work well for only nearby "
"objects. Other methods, like using the *cosmological redshift*, work only "
"for very distance galaxies. Thus, there are several methods, each with its "
"own limited validity, and hence the name."

"The bottom of the ladder consists of objects whose distances can be directly"
" measured, like the moon (see `Lunar Laser Ranging "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment>`__). The same"
" technique, using radio waves, is applied to find distances to planets as "
"well."

"\"Standard candles\" are objects whose intrinsic brightnesses we can know "
"for sure. The apparent :doc:`magnitude  <ai-magnitude>`, which is easy to "
"measure, tells us how bright an object appears, not how bright it actually "
"is. Distant objects appear less brighter, because their light gets spread "
"out over a larger area."

"In accordance with the *inverse square law* for light intensities, the "
"amount of light we receive from an object drops with the distance squared. "
"Thus, we may compute the distance to an object if we know both how bright it"
" actually is (absolute magnitude; 'M') and how bright it appears to us on "
"earth (apparent magnitude; 'm'). We may define the *distance modulus* as "
"follows:"

"There are many other methods. Some of them rely on the physics of stars, "
"such as the relationship between luminosity and color for various types of "
"stars (this is usually represented on a *Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram*). Some "
"of them work for star clusters, such as the *Moving cluster method* and the "
"*main-sequence fitting method*. The *Tully-Fisher relation* that relates the"
" brightness of a spiral galaxy to its rotation can be used to find the "
"distance modulus, since the rotation of a galaxy is easy to measure using "
"*Doppler shift*. Distances to distant galaxies may be found by measuring the"
" *Cosmological redshift*, which is the redshift of light from distance "
"galaxies that results from the expansion of the universe."
