"Logging is a very important tool in order to diagnose any issues with either"
" INDI drivers or Ekos. Before submitting any support request, the log must "
"be attached in order to help diagnose the exact issue. Depending on the "
"exact problem, you may need to enable logging for the feature or drivers "
"that exhibit issues. Enabling logging for everything is not recommended as "
"it will produce too much data that would be useful to diagnose the issue and"
" could result in missing the root cause all other. So only enable the "
"necessary logs."
