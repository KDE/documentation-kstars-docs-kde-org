"The ecliptic is an imaginary :doc:`Great Circle  <ai-greatcircle>` on the "
":doc:`Celestial Sphere  <ai-csphere>` along which the Sun appears to move "
"over the course of a year. Of course, it is really the Earth's orbit around "
"the Sun causing the change in the Sun's apparent direction. The ecliptic is "
"inclined from the :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` by 23.5 degrees. "
"The two points where the Ecliptic crosses the Celestial Equator are known as"
" the :doc:`Equinoxes  <ai-equinox>`."

"Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the planets are "
"also close to the plane of the ecliptic. In addition, the constellations of "
"the zodiac are located along the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very "
"useful line of reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the "
"constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally “follow the Sun”."

"Because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Ecliptic, the *Altitude* of the Sun "
"at noon changes over the course of the year, as it follows the path of the "
"Ecliptic across the sky. This causes the seasons. In the Summer, the Sun is "
"high in the sky at noon, and it remains above the :doc:`Horizon  <ai-"
"horizon>` for more than twelve hours. Whereas, in the winter, the Sun is low"
" in the sky at noon, and remains above the Horizon for less than twelve "
"hours. In addition, sunlight is received at the Earth's surface at a more "
"direct angle in the Summer, which means that a given area at the surface "
"receives more energy per second in the Summer than in Winter. The "
"differences in day duration and in energy received per unit area lead to the"
" differences in temperature we experience in Summer and Winter."

"Make sure your location is set to somewhere that is not very near the "
"equator for these experiments. Open the ``Configure - KStars`` window, and "
"switch to Horizontal coordinates, with the Opaque Ground shown. Open the "
"``Set Time`` window (**Ctrl**\\ +\\ **S**),and change the Date to sometime "
"in the middle of Summer, and the Time to 12:00 Noon. Back in the Main "
"Window, point toward the Southern Horizon (press **S**). Note the height of "
"the Sun above the Horizon at Noon in the Summer. Now, change the Date to "
"something in the middle of Winter (but keep the Time at 12:00 Noon). The Sun"
" is now much lower in the Sky. You will also notice that the day durations "
"are different if you open the ``What's up Tonight?`` tool for each date."
