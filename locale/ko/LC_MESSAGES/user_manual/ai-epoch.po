"An epoch is a certain instant of time (usually past) used as a reference for"
" time measurement in astronomy. In order to make calculations easier, "
"astronomers usually use the number of days that have passed since a certain "
"moment in time as a way of representing time in astronomical calculations. "
"This arbitrarily chosen \"starting point\" reference for time is called an "
"epoch."

"An epoch is usually cited along with :ref:`equatorial coordinates <ai-"
"skycoords-equatorial>` in astronomical catalogs, since the equatorial "
"coordinates of sky objects change (although slowly) with time. Printed star "
"charts / atlases are usually marked as being valid for a certain epoch."

"The most popular epoch used currently is J2000.0, (the :doc:`Julian year  "
"<ai-julianday>` 2000.0), which (almost exactly) corresponds to 1st January "
"2000, 12:00 noon UTC. Other epochs include B1900 and B1950."
