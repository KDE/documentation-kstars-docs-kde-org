":dfn:`Stars` are gigantic, self-gravitating spheres of (mostly) Hydrogen "
"gas.  Stars are also thermonuclear engines; nuclear fusion takes place deep "
"in the cores of stars, where the density is extreme and the temperature "
"reaches tens of millions of degrees Celsius."

"Yes, the Sun is a star.  It is the dominant centerpiece of our solar system."
"  Compared to other stars, our Sun is rather ordinary; it appears to be so "
"much bigger and brighter to us because it is millions of times closer than "
"any other star."

"The short answer is: star shine because they are very hot.  It is really no "
"more complicated than that.  Any object heated to thousands of degrees will "
"radiate light, just like stars do."

"This is a tougher question.  The usual answer is that stars get their heat "
"from the thermonuclear fusion reactions in their cores. However, this cannot"
" be the ultimate cause for the stars' heat, because a star must be hot in "
"the first place for nuclear fusion to be triggered.  Fusion can only sustain"
" the hot temperature; it cannot make a star hot.  A more correct answer is "
"that stars are hot because they have collapsed.  Stars form from diffuse "
"gaseous nebulae; as the nebulous gas condenses to form a star, the "
"gravitational potential energy of the material is released, first as kinetic"
" energy, and ultimately as heat as the density increases."

"Stars have many things in common: they are all collapsed spheres of hot, "
"dense gas (mostly Hydrogen), and nuclear fusion reactions are occurring at "
"or near the centers of every star in the sky."

"However, stars also show a great diversity in some properties. The brightest"
" stars shine almost 100 million times as brightly as the faintest stars.  "
"Stars range in surface temperature from only a few thousand degrees to "
"almost 50,000 degrees Celsius.  These differences are largely due to "
"differences in mass: massive stars are both hotter and brighter than lower-"
"mass stars.  The temperature and Luminosity also depend on the *evolutionary"
" state* of the star."

"The main sequence is the evolutionary state of a star when it is fusing "
"Hydrogen in its core.  This is the first (and longest) stage of a star's "
"life (not including protostar phases).  What happens to a star after it runs"
" out of core Hydrogen is addressed in the stellar evolution article (coming "
"soon)."

"The lifetime of a star depends very much on its mass.  More massive stars "
"are hotter and shine much more brightly, causing them to consume their "
"nuclear fuel much more rapidly.  The largest stars (roughly 100 times as "
"massive as the Sun), will run out of fuel in only a few million years; while"
" the smallest stars (roughly ten percent the mass of the Sun), with their "
"much more frugal consumption rate, will shine on (albeit dimly) "
"for*trillions* of years.  Note that this is much longer than the Universe "
"has yet been in existence."
