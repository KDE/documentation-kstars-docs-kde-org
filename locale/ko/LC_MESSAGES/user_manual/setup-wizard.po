"The second page of the Setup Wizard allows you to choose the starting "
"geographic location, by selecting from the list of the 3400+ known locations"
" on the right side of the window.  The list of locations can be filtered to "
"match the text you enter in the ``City filter:``, ``Province filter:``, and "
"``Country filter:`` edit boxes. If your desired location is not present in "
"the list, you can select a nearby city instead for now.  Later on, you can "
"add your precise location manually using the :doc:`Set Geographic Location "
"tool  <config-setgeo>`.  Once you have selected a starting location, press "
"the ``Next`` button."
