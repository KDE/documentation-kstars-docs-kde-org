"When KStars starts up, the time is set to your computer's system clock, and "
"the KStars clock is running to keep up with the real time. If you want to "
"stop the clock, select the ``Time`` → ``Stop Clock`` menu item, or simply "
"click on the ``Stop Clock`` icon in the toolbar. You can make the clock run "
"slower or faster than normal, or even make it run backward, using the time-"
"step spinbox in the toolbar. This spinbox has two sets of up/down buttons. "
"The first one will step through all 83 available time steps, one by one. The"
" second one will skip to the next higher (or lower) unit of time, which "
"allows you to make large timestep changes more quickly."

"You can set the time and date by selecting the ``Time`` → ``Set Time...`` "
"menu item, or by pressing the ``Time`` icon in the toolbar. The ``Set Time``"
" window uses a standard KDE Date Picker widget, coupled with a spinbox for "
"setting the hours and minutes. If you want to re-synchronize the simulation "
"clock back to the current CPU time, just select the ``Time`` → ``Set Time to"
" Now`` menu item."

"KStars can accept very remote dates beyond the usual limits imposed by "
"QDate. Currently, you can set the date between the years -100000 and "
"+100000. We may extend this range even further in future releases. However, "
"please be aware that the accuracy of the simulation becomes more and more "
"degraded as more remote dates are examined. This is especially true for the "
"positions of solar system bodies."
