"The ``Colors`` page allows you to set the color scheme, and to define custom"
" color schemes. The tab is split into two panels:"

"The left panel shows a list of all display items with adjustable colors. "
"Click on any item to bring up a color selection window to adjust its color. "
"Below the list is the ``Star color mode:`` dropdown box. By default, KStars "
"draws stars with a :doc:`realistic color  <ai-colorandtemp>` tint according "
"to the spectral type of the star. However, you may also choose to draw the "
"stars as solid white, black or red circles. If you are using the realistic "
"star colors, you can set the saturation level of the star colors with the "
"``Star color intensity:`` spinbox."

"The right panel lists the defined color schemes. There are four predefined "
"schemes: the ``Default Colors`` scheme, ``Star Chart``, which uses black "
"stars on a white background, ``Night Vision``, which uses only shades of red"
" in order to protect dark-adapted vision, and ``Moonless Night``, a more "
"realistic, dark theme. Additionally, you can save the current color settings"
" as a custom scheme by clicking the ``Save As...`` button. It will prompt "
"you for a name for the new scheme, and then your scheme will appear in the "
"list in all future KStars sessions. To remove a custom scheme, simply "
"highlight it in the list, and press the ``Remove`` button."
