"You can use KStars to generate an image of the sky without actually "
"launching the GUI portion of the program. To use this feature, start KStars "
"from a command prompt using arguments to specify the filename for the image,"
" as well as the desired image dimensions:"

"If no filename is specified, it generates a file named ``kstars.png``. It "
"will attempt to generate an image that matches the extension of your "
"filename. The following extensions are recognized: “png”, “jpg”, “jpeg”, "
"“gif”, “pnm”, and “bmp”. If the filename extension is not recognized, it "
"defaults to the PNG image type."

"By default, KStars will read in the options values stored in your "
"``$KDEHOME/share/config/kstarsrc`` file to determine where the image will be"
" centered, and how it is rendered. This means you need to run KStars in "
"normal GUI mode, and exit the program when it is set up with the desired "
"options for the generated images. This is not very flexible, so we also "
"provide the ability to execute a KStars D-Bus script to set the scene before"
" generating the image. The filename you specify as the script argument "
"should be a valid KStars D-Bus script, such as one created with the "
":doc:`Script Builder Tool <tool-scriptbuilder>`. The script can be used to "
"set where the image is pointing, set the geographic location, set the time "
"and date, change the Zoom level, and adjust other view options. Some of the "
"D-Bus functions make no sense in non-GUI mode (such as ``waitForKey()``); if"
" these functions are encountered while parsing the script, they are simply "
"ignored."

"By default, KStars will use the system CPU time and date for generating the "
"image. Alternatively, you may specify a time and date with the “--date” "
"argument. You can also use this argument for specifying the startup date in "
"normal GUI mode."
