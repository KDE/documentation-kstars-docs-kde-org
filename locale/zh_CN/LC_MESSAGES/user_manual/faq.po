"objects, the computational load is greatly reduced, which allows for "
"smoother scrolling. You can turn off this feature in the <guilabel>Configure "

"Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the "
"current epoch. The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like "
"analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few centuries. We learnt "
"in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the Sun, but "
"this is not strictly true. It would be true only if there was only one "
"planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun and the planet were both point "
"masses. As it is, the planets are constantly tugging on each other, "
"perturbing the orbits slightly, and tidal effects also induce precessional "
"wobbling. In fact, recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not "
"even be stable in the long term (&ie;, millions or billions of years). As a "
"rule of thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a "
"few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000."

"The moon's position is the most difficult to predict to high precision. This "
"is because its motion is quite perturbed by the Earth. Also, since it is so "
"nearby, even minute effects that would be undetectable in more distant "
"bodies are easily apparent in the moon."

"The objects with the worst long-term precision in the program are the comets "
"and asteroids. We use a very simplistic orbital model for the minor planets "
"that does not include third-body perturbations. Therefore, their positions "
"can only be trusted for dates near the present epoch. Even for the present "
"epoch, one can expect positional errors among the minor planets of order 10 "
"arcseconds or more."

"Why do I have to download an improved NGC/IC catalog and Messier object "

"The author of the downloadable NGC/IC catalog has released it with the "
"restriction that it may not be used commercially. For most &kstars; users, "
"this is not a problem. However, it is technically against the &kstars; "
"license (the <acronym>GPL</acronym>) to restrict usage in this way. We "
"removed the Messier object images from the standard distribution for two "
"reasons: to simply reduce the size of &kstars;, and also because of similar "
"licensing concerns with a couple of the images. The inline images are "
"significantly compressed to a very low quality from their original form, so "
"I doubt there is a real copyright concern, but I did obtain explicit "
"permission from the images' authors to use the few images for which there "
"was any question about it (see <filename>README.images</filename>). Still, "
"just to be absolutely safe, I removed them from the standard distribution, "
"and marked the download archive as being <quote>free for non-commercial use</"

"It depends on the image, but many of the images restrict against commercial "
"usage. The Image Viewer's statusbar will usually contain information about "
"the image's copyright holder, and what usage restrictions apply. As a rule "
"of thumb: anything published by NASA is in the public domain (including all "
"HST images). For everything else, you can pretty safely assume that the "
"images may not be used commercially without permission. When in doubt, "
"contact the image's copyright holder directly."
