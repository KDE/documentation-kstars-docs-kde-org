msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/faq.rst:55
msgid ""
"When the display is in motion, KStars must recompute the screen coordinates "
"of every object in its database, which involves some pretty heavy "
"trigonometry.  When scrolling the display (either with the arrow keys or by "
"dragging with the mouse), the display may become slow and jerky, because the "
"computer is having trouble keeping up.  By excluding many of the objects, "
"the computational load is greatly reduced, which allows for smoother "
"scrolling.  You can turn off this feature in the ``Configure - KStars`` "
"window, and you can also configure which objects get hidden."

"KStars is pretty accurate, but it is not (yet) as precise as it can possibly "
"be.  The problem with high-precision calculations is that you start having "
"to deal with a large number of complicating factors. If you are not a "

"accuracy or precision."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the "
"current epoch.  The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like "
"analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few centuries.  We "
"learnt in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the "
"Sun, but this is not strictly true.  It would be true only if there was only "
"one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun and the planet were both "
"point masses.  As it is, the planets are constantly tugging on each other, "
"perturbing the orbits slightly, and tidal effects also induce precessional "
"wobbling.  In fact, recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may "
"not even be stable in the long term (i.e., millions or billions of years).  "
"As a rule of thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate "
"to a few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000. Pluto is the exception "
"to this; its position is perhaps ten times less precise than the positions "
"of the other planets.  Still, for dates near the present epoch, its position "
"can be trusted to about an arcsecond. The moon's position is the most "
"difficult to predict to high precision. This is because its motion is quite "
"perturbed by the Earth.  Also, since it is so nearby, even minute effects "
"that would be undetectable in more distant bodies are easily apparent in the "
"moon. The objects with the worst long-term precision in the program are the "
"comets and asteroids.  We use a very simplistic orbital model for the minor "
"planets that does not include third-body perturbations. Therefore, their "
"positions can only be trusted for dates near the present epoch.  Even for "
"the present epoch, one can expect positional errors among the minor planets "
"of order 10 arcseconds or more."

"**Why do I have to download an improved NGC/IC catalog and Messier object "
"images?  Why not just include them as part of the KStars distribution?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/faq.rst:123
msgid ""
"The author of the downloadable NGC/IC catalog has released it with the "
"restriction that it may not be used commercially.  For most KStars users, "
"this is not a problem.  However, it is technically against the KStars "
"license (the GPL) to restrict usage in this way.  We removed the Messier "
"object images from the standard distribution for two reasons:  to simply "
"reduce the size of KStars, and also because of similar licensing concerns "
"with a couple of the images.  The inline images are significantly compressed "
"to a very low quality from their original form, so I doubt there is a real "
"copyright concern, but I did obtain explicit permission from the images' "
"authors to use the few images for which there was any question about it "
"(see :file:`README.images`).  Still, just to be absolutely safe, I removed "
"them from the standard distribution, and marked the download archive as "
"being ``free for non-commercial use``."

msgid ""
"It depends on the image, but many of the images restrict against commercial "
"usage.  The Image Viewer's statusbar will usually contain information about "
"the image's copyright holder, and what usage restrictions apply.  As a rule "
"of thumb:  anything published by NASA is in the public domain (including all "
"HST images).  For everything else, you can pretty safely assume that the "
"images may not be used commercially without permission.  When in doubt, "
"contact the image's copyright holder directly."
