"*Parallax* is the apparent change of an observed object's position caused by"
" a shift in the observer's position. As an example, hold your hand in front "
"of you at arm's length, and observe an object on the other side of the room "
"behind your hand. Now tilt your head to your right shoulder, and your hand "
"will appear on the left side of the distant object. Tilt your head to your "
"left shoulder, and your hand will appear to shift to the right side of the "
"distant object."

"Because the Earth is in orbit around the Sun, we observe the sky from a "
"constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an "
"*annual parallax* effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to"
" “wobble” back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does"
" in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great "
"that you need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it\\ "

"Modern telescopes allow astronomers to use the annual parallax to measure "
"the distance to nearby stars, using triangulation. The astronomer carefully "
"measures the position of the star on two dates, spaced six months apart. The"
" nearer the star is to the Sun, the larger the apparent shift in its "
"position will be between the two dates."

"Over the six-month period, the Earth has moved through half its orbit around"
" the Sun; in this time its position has changed by 2 *Astronomical Units* "
"(abbreviated AU; 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, or about "
"150 million kilometers). This sounds like a really long distance, but even "
"the nearest star to the Sun (alpha Centauri) is about 40 *trillion* "
"kilometers away. Therefore, the annual parallax is very small, typically "
"smaller than one *arcsecond*, which is only 1/3600 of one degree. A "
"convenient distance unit for nearby stars is the *parsec*, which is short "
"for \"parallax arcsecond\". One parsec is the distance a star would have if "
"its observed parallax angle was one arcsecond. It is equal to 3.26 light-"
"years, or 31 trillion kilometers\\ `[3] <#ftn.id11475>`__."

"`[2] <#id11467>`__ The ancient Greek astronomers knew about parallax; "
"because they could not observe an annual parallax in the positions of stars,"
" they concluded that the Earth could not be in motion around the Sun. What "
"they did not realize was that the stars are millions of times further away "
"than the Sun, so the parallax effect is impossible to see with the unaided "
"eye."

"`[3] <#id11475>`__ Astronomers like this unit so much that they now use "
"“kiloparsecs” to measure galaxy-scale distances, and “Megaparsecs” to "
"measure intergalactic distances, even though these distances are much too "
"large to have an actual, observable parallax. Other methods are required to "
"determine these distances"
