"The sky appears to drift overhead from east to west, completing a full "
"circuit around the sky in 24 (:doc:`Sidereal <ai-sidereal>`) hours. This "
"phenomenon is due to the spinning of the Earth on its axis. The Earth's spin "
"axis intersects the :doc:`Celestial Sphere <ai-csphere>` at two points. "
"These points are the *Celestial Poles*. As the Earth spins; they remain "
"fixed in the sky, and all other points seem to rotate around them. The "
"celestial poles are also the poles of the :ref:`Equatorial Coordinate System "
"<ai-skycoords-equatorial>`, meaning they have *Declinations* of +90 degrees "
"and -90 degrees (for the North and South celestial poles, respectively)."

"The North Celestial Pole currently has nearly the same coordinates as the "
"bright star *Polaris* (which is Latin for “Pole Star”). This makes Polaris "
"useful for navigation: not only is it always above the North point of the "
"horizon, but its :ref:`Altitude <ai-skycoords-horizontal>` angle is always "
"(nearly) equal to the observer's :doc:`Geographic Latitude <ai-geocoords>` "
"(however, Polaris can only be seen from locations in the Northern "
"hemisphere)."

"The fact that Polaris is near the pole is purely a coincidence. In fact, "
"because of :doc:`Precession <ai-precession>`, Polaris is only near the pole "
"for a small fraction of the time."

"Use the ``Find Object`` window (**Ctrl**\\ +\\ **F**) to locate Polaris. "
"Notice that its Declination is almost (but not exactly) +90 degrees. Compare "
"the Altitude reading when focused on Polaris to your location's geographic "
"latitude. They are always within one degree of each other. They are not "
"exactly the same because Polaris isn't exactly at the Pole. (you can point "
"exactly at the pole by switching to Equatorial coordinates, and pressing the "
"up-arrow key until the sky stops scrolling)."

"Use the ``Time Step`` spinbox in the toolbar to accelerate time to a step of "
"100 seconds. You can see the entire sky appears to rotate around Polaris, "
"while Polaris itself remains nearly stationary."

"We said that the celestial pole is the pole of the Equatorial coordinate "
"system. What do you think is the pole of the horizontal (Altitude/Azimuth) "
"coordinate system? (The :doc:`Zenith <ai-zenith>`)."
