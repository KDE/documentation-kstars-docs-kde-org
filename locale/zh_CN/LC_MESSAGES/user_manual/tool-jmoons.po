"This tool displays the positions of Jupiter's four largest moons (Io, "
"Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) relative to Jupiter, as a function of time. "
"Time is plotted vertically; the units are days and “time=0.0” corresponds to "
"the current simulation time. The horizontal axis displays the angular offset "
"from Jupiter's position, in arcminutes. The offset is measured along the "
"direction of Jupiter's equator. Each moon's position as a function of time "
"traces a sinusoidal path in the plot, as the moon orbits around Jupiter. "
"Each track is assigned a different color to distinguish it from the others; "
"the name labels at the top of the window indicate the color used by each "
"moon (i.e. red for Io, yellow for Europa, green for Callisto and blue for "
"Ganymede)."

"The plot can be manipulated with the keyboard. The time axis can be expanded "
"or compressed using the **+** and **-** keys. The time displayed at the "
"center of the window can be changed with the **[** and **]** keys."
