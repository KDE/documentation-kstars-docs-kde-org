"This tool displays the positions of Jupiter's four largest moons (Io, "
"Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) relative to Jupiter, as a function of time. "
"Time is plotted vertically; the units are days and “time=0.0” corresponds to"
" the current simulation time. The horizontal axis displays the angular "
"offset from Jupiter's position, in arcminutes. The offset is measured along "
"the direction of Jupiter's equator. Each moon's position as a function of "
"time traces a sinusoidal path in the plot, as the moon orbits around "
"Jupiter. Each track is assigned a different color to distinguish it from the"
" others; the name labels at the top of the window indicate the color used by"
" each moon (i.e. red for Io, yellow for Europa, green for Callisto and blue "
"for Ganymede)."

"The plot can be manipulated with the keyboard. The time axis can be expanded"
" or compressed using the **+** and **-** keys. The time displayed at the "
"center of the window can be changed with the **[** and **]** keys."
