"Now that we have the time and location set, let us have a look around. You "
"can pan the display using the arrow keys. If you hold down the **Shift** key "
"before panning, the scrolling speed is increased. The display can also be "
"panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Note that while the display "
"is scrolling, not all objects are displayed. This is done to cut down on the "
"CPU load of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother "
"(you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the :doc:`Configure - "
"KStars  <config>` window). There are several ways to change the "
"magnification (or *Zoom level*) of the display:"
