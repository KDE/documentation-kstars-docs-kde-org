"Invented in Holland at the beginning of the 17th century, telescopes are the"
" tools used by astronomers and astrophysicists for their observations. With "
"the development of modern science, telescopes are nowadays used for "
"observing in all ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, inside and outside "
"Earth's atmosphere. Telescopes work by collecting light with a large surface"
" aerie called objective that makes the incoming light to converge. The final"
" image will be viewed by using an eyepiece."

"Telescopes are used in order to collect light from celestial objects and to "
"converge it to a point, named the focal point. They are described by two "
"parameters, *aperture* and *Focal Ratio*. The diameter of the light "
"collecting surface is called the *aperture* of the telescope – the bigger "
"the aperture, the brighter the image. The ratio of the focal length *f* to "
"the *aperture D* of a telescope is defined as the *focal ratio*. This "
"describes the light gathering power of a telescope. “Fast” telescopes have "
"smaller focal ratios, as they obtain brighter images in a smaller exposure "
"time. As the focal ratio gets bigger, the telescope needs more exposure time"
" in order to obtain a bright image, which is why it is “slower”. The focal "
"ratio is usually denoted as “f/n”, where n is the ratio of the focal length "
"to the aperture."

"In order to obtain an image, telescopes use lenses or mirrors. "
"Unfortunately, if we use both of them we obtain image distortions known as "
"*aberrations*. Some aberrations are common for both lenses and mirrors, like"
" *astigmatism* and *curvature of field*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/ai-telescopes.rst:49
msgid ""
"*Astigmatism* appears when different parts of the lens or mirror make the "
"rays of the incoming light to converge in slightly different locations on "
"the focal plane. When corrected for astigmatism, *curvature of field* may "
"appear on the surface of the lens/ mirror, which makes the light to converge"
" on a curve rather than on a plane."

"Still, there are also lens specific aberrations and mirror specific "
"aberrations."

"*Chromatic aberration* is a feature of telescopes that use lenses to "
"converge the light. Mainly, the focal length of a lens is wavelength "
"dependent, which means that the focal point of blue light differs from that "
"of the red light. This results in a blurred image. The effect of chromatic "
"aberration can be diminished by adding correcting lenses into the system. "
"*Spherical* aberration may also be a problem for lenses, resulting from "
"their shape. Spheroid surfaces will not make the incoming light to converge "
"to a single point, which is why other optical surfaces like paraboloids are "
"preferred. Even by using them we aren't still out of trouble, as coma "
"aberration appears in this case. It results from the dependence of the focal"
" length on the angle between the direction of the incoming ray and the "
"optical axis of the system. Thus, images of points that lie off the optical "
"axis are elongated, rather than being simple points, as it would be normal."

"*Magnification*, the increase in angular size of an object as viewed in a "

"eyepiece."

"*Reflecting Telescopes*, on the other side, use mirrors instead of lenses in"
" order to obtain the final image. By replacing the objective lens with a "
"mirror, we obtain a focal point that lies on the path of the incoming light."
" An observer situated at this point could see an image, but he would block "
"part of the incoming light. The focal point of the principal mirror is "
"called *prime focus*, and this is also the name of the first category of "
"reflecting telescopes. Thus, prime focus telescopes use a mirror in order to"
" collect light from a celestial object and by reflection the image of the "
"object may be observed from the prime focus of the telescope. Other types of"
" reflecting telescopes are *Newtonian*, *Cassegrain* and *Coude*."

"*The Newtonian* one uses an additional flat mirror placed in the vicinity of"
" the prime focus, in the path of the reflected light. This results in moving"
" the focal point to a different location, on one of the sides of the "
"telescope, more accessible for observing. Of course, a mirror placed in the "

"*The Cassegrain* telescope is similar to the Newtonian one but this time the"
" secondary mirror reflects light to the bottom of the telescope. There is a "
"hole at the center of the primary mirror that lets the reflected light to go"
" on its way until it converges to the focal point. The secondary mirror "
"needs to be convex, as it is increasing the focal length of the optical "
"system. The primary mirror of a Cassegrain Telescope is a paraboloid. By "
"replacing it with a hyperboloid we obtain a Ritchey-Chretien telescope. The "
"advantage of using a *Ritchey-Chretien* telescope is that it removes the "
"coma of the classical reflectors."

"*The Coude* type consists of more than one mirror that reflects the light to"

"advantages of using a Coude telescope are varied, from obtaining a long "
"focal length useful in different fields of astronomy and astrophysics, like "
"spectroscopy to avoiding the usage of a massive instrument. But there are "
"also disadvantages in using a Coude telescope, because the more mirrors are "
"placed in the system, the less amount of light arrives at the detector. This"
" happens because by using Aluminum mirrors, only 80 % of the incident light "
"gets reflected."

"*Catadioptrics* are types of telescopes that use systems of both lenses and "

"the *Schmidt-Cassegrain* telescope. It has the advantage of providing a "
"large angle field of view. In order to minimize coma, it uses a primary "
"spheroidal mirror with a thin correcting lens that removes spherical "
"aberrations. The secondary mirror is placed in the center of the correcting "
"lens, reflecting light through a hole made in the primary mirror. Not as "
"famous as the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope but common though is the "
"*Maksutov* telescope that also uses a correcting lens with the primary "

"For a detailed analysis of the sky, observations are also carried in other "
"regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Very popular and efficient are "
"*radio telescopes*, developed mostly in the last century. A common problem "
"for both radio and optical telescopes is the need for better resolution. We "
"can derive the resolution of a telescope by using Rayleigh criterion, that "
"states the resolving power is equal to the ratio of the incoming wavelength "
"to the diameter of the aperture (times 1.22 for circular apertures). So for "
"a good resolution we need a diameter as big as possible. The biggest radio "
"telescope in the world is the Arecibo telescope from Puerto Rico that uses a"
" huge dish of 305 m diameter. In order to solve the problem for resolutions,"
" astronomers have developed a new technique called interferometry. The basic"
" principal of interferometry is that by observing the same object with two "
"distinct telescopes we can obtain a final image by \"connecting\" the two "
"initial ones. Nowadays, the most efficient observatory that uses "
"interferometry is the Very Large Array located near Socorro, New Mexico. It "
"uses 27 telescopes placed in a \"Y\" shape, with 25 m aperture each. There "
"also exists a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) that"
" allows astronomers to resolve images over the size of continents. The "
"biggest project of the century in this domain is the building of the Atacama"
" Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which will be using 66 telescopes placed in "
"the Atacama desert of northern Chile."

"Because Earth-based observations are affected by extinction due Earth's "

"mirror, the smoothest mirror ever constructed. The Hubble Space Telescope is"
" placed on a low-orbit around Earth and because of the lack of atmosphere it"
" can observe very faint objects. Another Space Telescope is the *James Webb "
"Space Telescope (JWST)* which is planned to be launched in 2018. It will "
"have a 6.5m primary mirror and it will orbit around a gravitation stable "
"point on the Sun-Earth line known as the Second Lagrange Point (L2). Here "
"the gravitational attractions due to both Sun and Earth balances the "
"centrifugal force of an object set in motion around the Sun. This point has "
"the special property that if an object is placed here, it is in equilibrium "
"with respect to the Sun-Earth system. The second Lagrange Point lies on the "
"line connecting Sun and Earth, on the other side of the Earth. So a "
"telescope placed here will receive less thermal radiation, which will "
"improve Infrared Observations."
