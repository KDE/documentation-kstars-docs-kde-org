"There is a list of over 3400 predefined cities available to choose from. You "
"set your location by highlighting a city from this list. Each city is "
"represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city is highlighted "
"in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location in the map."

"It is not practical to scroll through the full list of 3400 locations, "
"looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be "
"filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in the "
"screenshot, the text **A** appears in the ``City filter:`` box, while **Te** "
"has been entered in the ``Province filter:`` box, and **USA** is in the "
"``Country filter:`` box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list "
"have city, province, and country names that begin with the entered filter "
"strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 6 cities "
"are matched by the filters. Also notice that the dots representing these six "
"cities in the map have been colored white, while the unmatched cities remain "
"gray."

"The list can also be filtered by location in the map.  Clicking anywhere in "
"the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the clicked "
"location. At this time, you can search by name, or by location, but not both "
"at once. In other words, when you click on the map, the name filters are "
"ignored, and vice versa."

"The :doc:`longitude, latitude  <ai-geocoords>` and :doc:`time zone  <ai-"
"timezones>` information for the currently-selected location are displayed in "
"the boxes at the bottom of the window. If you feel that any of these values "
"are inaccurate, you can modify them and press the ``+`` (Add City) button to "
"record your custom version of the location. You can also define a completely "
"new location by pressing the ``Clear Fields`` button, and entering the data "
"for the new location. Note that all fields except the optional ``Province:``/"
"``Country:`` must be filled before the new location can be added to the "
"list. KStars will automatically load your custom locations for all future "
"sessions. Please note, at this point, the only way to remove a custom "
"location is to remove the appropriate line from the file ``kstars/"
"mycities.dat`` in your folder `qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation` ."
