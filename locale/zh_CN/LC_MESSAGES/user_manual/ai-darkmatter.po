"Scientists are now quite comfortable with the idea that 90% of the mass in "

"Despite comprehensive maps of the nearby universe that cover the spectrum "
"from radio to gamma rays, we are only able to account of 10% of the mass "
"that must be out there. As Bruce H. Margon, an astronomer at the University "
"of Washington, told the New York Times in 2001: “It's a fairly embarrassing "
"situation to admit that we can't find 90 percent of the universe.”"

"The term given this “missing mass” is *Dark Matter*, and those two words "
"pretty well sum up everything we know about it at this point. We know there "
"is “Matter”, because we can see the effects of its gravitational influence. "
"However, the matter emits no detectable electromagnetic radiation at all, "
"hence it is “Dark”. There exist several theories to account for the missing "
"mass ranging from exotic subatomic particles, to a population of isolated "
"black holes, to less exotic brown and white dwarfs. The term “missing mass” "
"might be misleading, since the mass itself is not missing, just its light. "
"But what is exactly dark matter and how do we really know it exists, if we "
"cannot see it?"

"The story began in 1933 when Astronomer Fritz Zwicky was studying the "
"motions of distant and massive clusters of galaxies, specifically the Coma "
"cluster and the Virgo cluster. Zwicky estimated the mass of each galaxy in "
"the cluster based on their luminosity, and added up all of the galaxy masses "
"to get a total cluster mass. He then made a second, independent estimate of "
"the cluster mass, based on measuring the spread in velocities of the "
"individual galaxies in the cluster. To his surprise, this second *dynamical "
"mass* estimate was *400 times* larger than the estimate based on the galaxy "
"light."

"Although the evidence was strong at Zwicky's time, it was not until the "
"1970s that scientists began to explore this discrepancy comprehensively. It "
"was at this time that the existence of Dark Matter began to be taken "
"seriously. The existence of such matter would not only resolve the mass "
"deficit in galaxy clusters; it would also have far more reaching "
"consequences for the evolution and fate of the universe itself."

"Another phenomenon that suggested the need for dark matter is the rotational "
"curves of *Spiral Galaxies*. Spiral Galaxies contain a large population of "
"stars that orbit the Galactic center on nearly circular orbits, much like "
"planets orbit a star. Like planetary orbits, stars with larger galactic "
"orbits are expected to have slower orbital speeds (this is just a statement "
"of Kepler's 3rd Law). Actually, Kepler's 3rd Law only applies to stars near "
"the perimeter of a Spiral Galaxy, because it assumes the mass enclosed by "
"the orbit to be constant."

"However, astronomers have made observations of the orbital speeds of stars "
"in the outer parts of a large number of spiral galaxies, and none of them "
"follow Kepler's 3rd Law as expected. Instead of falling off at larger radii, "
"the orbital speeds remain remarkably constant. The implication is that the "
"mass enclosed by larger-radius orbits increases, even for stars that are "
"apparently near the edge of the galaxy. While they are near the edge of the "
"luminous part of the galaxy, the galaxy has a mass profile that apparently "
"continues well beyond the regions occupied by stars."

"Here is another way to think about it: Consider the stars near the perimeter "
"of a spiral galaxy, with typical observed orbital velocities of 200 "
"kilometers per second. If the galaxy consisted of only the matter that we "
"can see, these stars would very quickly fly off from the galaxy, because "
"their orbital speeds are four times larger than the galaxy's escape "
"velocity. Since galaxies are not seen to be spinning apart, there must be "
"mass in the galaxy that we are not accounting for when we add up all the "
"parts we can see."

"Several theories have surfaced in literature to account for the missing mass "
"such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), MACHOs (MAssive "
"Compact Halo Objects), primordial black holes, massive neutrinos, and "
"others; each with their pros and cons. No single theory has yet been "
"accepted by the astronomical community, because we so far lack the means to "
"conclusively test one theory against the other."

"You can see the galaxy clusters that Professor Zwicky studied to discover "
"Dark Matter. Use the KStars ``Find Object`` window (**Ctrl**\\ +\\ **F**) to "
"center on “M 87” to find the Virgo Cluster, and on “NGC 4884” to find the "
"Coma Cluster. You may have to zoom in to see the galaxies. Note that the "
"Virgo Cluster appears to be much larger on the sky. In reality, Coma is the "
"larger cluster; it only appears smaller because it is further away."
