"As explained in the :doc:`Sidereal Time  <ai-sidereal>` article, the *Right "
"Ascension* of an object indicates the Sidereal Time at which it will transit"
" across your :doc:`Local Meridian  <ai-meridian>`. An object's *Hour Angle* "
"is defined as the difference between the current Local Sidereal Time and the"
" Right Ascension of the object:"

"Thus, the object's Hour Angle indicates how much Sidereal Time has passed "
"since the object was on the Local Meridian. It is also the angular distance "
"between the object and the meridian, measured in hours (1 hour = 15 "
"degrees). For example, if an object has an hour angle of 2.5 hours, it "
"transited across the Local Meridian 2.5 hours ago, and is currently 37.5 "
"degrees West of the Meridian. Negative Hour Angles indicate the time until "
"the *next* transit across the Local Meridian. Of course, an Hour Angle of "
"zero means the object is currently on the Local Meridian."
