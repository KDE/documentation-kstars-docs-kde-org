"The FITS Viewer Solver is used to plate-solve the image loaded in the FITS "
"Viewer's tab. It only works with the internal StellarSolver. You get the RA "
"and DEC coordinates for the center of the image, the image's scale, the "
"angle of rotation, and the number of stars detected in the image. Its main "
"use case is debugging plate-solving issues in Ekos, though the information "
"displayed can be generally useful. The controls and displays are described "
"below."

"Scale: Checking the Use Scale checkbox constrains the solver to use "
"approximately the pixel or image scale given. The scale is entered in the "
"box and the units for the scale can be chosen from image width in degrees, "
"image width in arc-minutes, and arc-seconds per pixel. When a solve "
"successfully completes, it replaces the value in the box with solution's "
"scale."

"Position: Checking the Use Position checkbox constrains the solver to search "
"near the RA and DEC coordinates given. The extent of the search is given by "
"the user in the Radius box in degrees. Note that RA is input in hours-"
"minutes-seconds, e.g. 13h, and DEC is input in degrees-minutes-seconds, e.g. "
"85. When a solve successfully completes, it replaces the value in the RA and "
"DEC boxes with solution's coordinates. In addition it fills in the Angle "
"field with the solutions angle value in degrees."
