"Locations on Earth can be specified using a spherical coordinate system. The "
"geographic (<quote>earth-mapping</quote>) coordinate system is aligned with "
"the spin axis of the Earth. It defines two angles measured from the center "
"of the Earth. One angle, called the <firstterm>Latitude</firstterm>, "
"measures the angle between any point and the Equator. The other angle, "
"called the <firstterm>Longitude</firstterm>, measures the angle "
"<emphasis>along</emphasis> the Equator from an arbitrary point on the Earth "
"(Greenwich, England is the accepted zero-longitude point in most modern "
"societies)."

"By combining these two angles, any location on Earth can be specified. For "
"example, Baltimore, Maryland (USA) has a latitude of 39.3 degrees North, and "
"a longitude of 76.6 degrees West. So, a vector drawn from the center of the "
"Earth to a point 39.3 degrees above the Equator and 76.6 degrees west of "
"Greenwich, England will pass through Baltimore."

"The Equator is obviously an important part of this coordinate system; it "
"represents the <emphasis>zeropoint</emphasis> of the latitude angle, and the "
"halfway point between the poles. The Equator is the <firstterm>Fundamental "
"Plane</firstterm> of the geographic coordinate system. <link linkend=\"ai-"
"skycoords\">All Spherical Coordinate Systems</link> define such a "
"Fundamental Plane."

"Lines of constant Latitude are called <firstterm>Parallels</firstterm>. They "
"trace circles on the surface of the Earth, but the only parallel that is a "
"<link linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">Great Circle</link> is the Equator "
"(Latitude=0 degrees). Lines of constant Longitude are called "
"<firstterm>Meridians</firstterm>. The Meridian passing through Greenwich is "
"the <firstterm>Prime Meridian</firstterm> (longitude=0 degrees). Unlike "
"Parallels, all Meridians are great circles, and Meridians are not parallel: "
"they intersect at the north and south poles."

"This is a trick question. The Longitude is meaningless at the north pole "
