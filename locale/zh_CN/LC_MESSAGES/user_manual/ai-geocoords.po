"Locations on Earth can be specified using a spherical coordinate system. The"
" geographic (“earth-mapping”) coordinate system is aligned with the spin "
"axis of the Earth. It defines two angles measured from the center of the "
"Earth. One angle, called the *Latitude*, measures the angle between any "
"point and the Equator. The other angle, called the *Longitude*, measures the"
" angle *along* the Equator from an arbitrary point on the Earth (Greenwich, "
"England is the accepted zero-longitude point in most modern societies)."

"By combining these two angles, any location on Earth can be specified. For "
"example, Baltimore, Maryland (USA) has a latitude of 39.3 degrees North, and"
" a longitude of 76.6 degrees West. So, a vector drawn from the center of the"
" Earth to a point 39.3 degrees above the Equator and 76.6 degrees west of "
"Greenwich, England will pass through Baltimore."

"The Equator is obviously an important part of this coordinate system; it "
"represents the *zeropoint* of the latitude angle, and the halfway point "
"between the poles. The Equator is the *Fundamental Plane* of the geographic "
"coordinate system. :doc:`All Spherical Coordinate Systems  <ai-skycoords>` "
"define such a Fundamental Plane."

"Lines of constant Latitude are called *Parallels*. They trace circles on the"
" surface of the Earth, but the only parallel that is a :doc:`Great Circle  "
"<ai-greatcircle>` is the Equator (Latitude=0 degrees). Lines of constant "
"Longitude are called *Meridians*. The Meridian passing through Greenwich is "
"the *Prime Meridian* (longitude=0 degrees). Unlike Parallels, all Meridians "
"are great circles, and Meridians are not parallel: they intersect at the "
"north and south poles."

"This is a trick question. The Longitude is meaningless at the north pole "
"(and the south pole too). It has all longitudes at the same time."
