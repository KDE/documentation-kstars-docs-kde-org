"All stars radiate light over a broad range of frequencies in the "
"electromagnetic spectrum from the low energy radio waves up to the highly "
"energetic gamma rays. A star that emits predominately in the ultra-violet "
"region of the spectrum produces a total amount of energy magnitudes larger "
"than that produced in a star that emits principally in the infrared. "
"Therefore, luminosity is a measure of energy emitted by a star over all "
"wavelengths. The relationship between wavelength and energy was quantified "
"by Einstein as E = h \\* v where v is the frequency, h is the Planck "
"constant, and E is the photon energy in joules. That is, shorter wavelengths "
"(and thus higher frequencies) correspond to higher energies."

"For example, a wavelength of lambda = 10 meter lies in the radio region of "
"the electromagnetic spectrum and has a frequency of f = c / lambda = 3 \\* "
"10\\ :sup:`8` m/s / 10 = 30 MHz where c is the speed of light. The energy of "
"this photon is E = h \\* v = 6.625 \\* 10\\ :sup:`-34` J s \\* 30 Mhz = "
"1.988 \\* 10\\ :sup:`-26` joules. On the other hand, visible light has much "
"shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies. A photon that has a wavelength "
"of lambda = 5 \\* 10\\ :sup:`-9` meters (A greenish photon) has an energy E "
"= 3.975 \\* 10\\ :sup:`-17` joules which is over a billion times higher than "
"the energy of a radio photon. Similarly, a photon of red light (wavelength "
"lambda = 700 nm) has less energy than a photon of violet light (wavelength "
"lambda = 400 nm)."

"Luminosity depends both on temperature and surface area. This makes sense "
"because a burning log radiates more energy than a match, even though both "
"have the same temperature. Similarly, an iron rod heated to 2000 degrees "
"emits more energy than when it is heated to only 200 degrees."

"Luminosity is a very fundamental quantity in Astronomy and Astrophysics. "
"Much of what is learnt about celestial objects comes from analyzing their "
"light. This is because the physical processes that occur inside stars gets "
"recorded and transmitted by light. Luminosity is measured in units of energy "
"per second. Astronomers prefer to use Ergs, rather than Watts, when "
"quantifying luminosity."
