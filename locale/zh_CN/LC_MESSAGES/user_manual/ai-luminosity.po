"All stars radiate light over a broad range of frequencies in the "
"electromagnetic spectrum from the low energy radio waves up to the highly "
"energetic gamma rays. A star that emits predominately in the ultra-violet "
"region of the spectrum produces a total amount of energy magnitudes larger "
"than that produced in a star that emits principally in the infrared. "
"Therefore, luminosity is a measure of energy emitted by a star over all "
"wavelengths. The relationship between wavelength and energy was quantified "
"by Einstein as E = h * v where v is the frequency, h is the Planck constant, "
"and E is the photon energy in joules. That is, shorter wavelengths (and thus "
"higher frequencies) correspond to higher energies."

"For example, a wavelength of lambda = 10 meter lies in the radio region of "
"the electromagnetic spectrum and has a frequency of f = c / lambda = 3 * "
"10<superscript>8</superscript> m/s / 10 = 30 MHz where c is the speed of "
"light. The energy of this photon is E = h * v = 6.625 * 10<superscript>-34</"
"superscript> J s * 30 Mhz = 1.988 * 10<superscript>-26</superscript> joules. "
"On the other hand, visible light has much shorter wavelengths and higher "
"frequencies. A photon that has a wavelength of lambda = 5 * "
"10<superscript>-9</superscript> meters (A greenish photon) has an energy E = "
"3.975 * 10<superscript>-17</superscript> joules which is over a billion "
"times higher than the energy of a radio photon. Similarly, a photon of red "
"light (wavelength lambda = 700 nm) has less energy than a photon of violet "
"light (wavelength lambda = 400 nm)."

"Luminosity depends both on temperature and surface area. This makes sense "
"because a burning log radiates more energy than a match, even though both "
"have the same temperature. Similarly, an iron rod heated to 2000 degrees "
"emits more energy than when it is heated to only 200 degrees."

"Luminosity is a very fundamental quantity in Astronomy and Astrophysics. "
"Much of what is learnt about celestial objects comes from analyzing their "
"light. This is because the physical processes that occur inside stars gets "
"recorded and transmitted by light. Luminosity is measured in units of energy "
"per second. Astronomers prefer to use Ergs, rather than Watts, when "
"quantifying luminosity."
