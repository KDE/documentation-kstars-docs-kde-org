"storage, transmission and processing of digital data. For the details, one "
"is referred to the `corresponding Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia."

"The ``Single preview tab`` item is to display all captured FITS images in a "
"single tab instead of multiple tabs per image. The ``Single window capture`` "
"item is to display captured FITS images from all cameras in a single FITS "
"Viewer window instead of a dedicated window to each camera. The ``Single "
"window open`` item is to display opened FITS images in a single FITS Viewer "
"window instead of a dedicated window to each file and the ``Independent "
"window`` item is to make FITS Viewer window independent from KStars."

"The right panel lists processing options. The ``Auto stretch`` item is to "
"always apply auto stretch to images in FITS Viewer, ``Limited resources "
"mode`` is to enable limited resource mode to turn off any resource-intensive "
"operations, namely: ``Auto debayer`` (bayered images will not be debayered; "
"only grayscale images are shown), ``Auto WCS`` (World Coordinate System data "
"will not be processed; WCS maps sky coordinates to image coordinates; "
"equatorial grid lines, object identification, and telescope slew within an "
"image are disabled), and ``3D cube`` (RGB images will not be processed; only "
"grayscale images are shown). You can switch off some of these resource-"
"greedy operations separately as well."
