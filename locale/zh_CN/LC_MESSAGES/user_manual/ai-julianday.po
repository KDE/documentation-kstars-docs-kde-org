"Julian Days are a way of reckoning the current date by a simple count of the "
"number of days that have passed since some remote, arbitrary date. This "
"number of days is called the *Julian Day*, abbreviated as JD. The starting "
"point, JD=0, is January 1, 4713 BC (or -4712 January 1, since there was no "
"year '0'). Julian Days are very useful because they make it easy to "
"determine the number of days between two events by simply subtracting their "
"Julian Day numbers. Such a calculation is difficult for the standard "
"(Gregorian) calendar, because days are grouped into months, which contain a "
"variable number of days, and there is the added complication of :doc:`Leap "
"Years  <ai-leapyear>`."

"Converting from the standard (Gregorian) calendar to Julian Days and vice "
"versa is best left to a special program written to do this, such as the "
"KStars :doc:`Astrocalculator  <tool-calculator>`. However, for those "
"interested, here is a simple example of a Gregorian to Julian day converter:"

"Julian Days can also be used to tell time; the time of day is expressed as a "
"fraction of a full day, with 12:00 noon (not midnight) as the zero point. "
"So, 3:00 pm on 1 Jan 1970 is JD 2440588.125 (since 3:00 pm is 3 hours since "
"noon, and 3/24 = 0.125 day). Note that the Julian Day is always determined "
"from :doc:`Universal Time  <ai-utime>`, not Local Time."
