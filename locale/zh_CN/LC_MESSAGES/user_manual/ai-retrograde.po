"*Retrograde Motion* is the orbital motion of a body in a direction opposite "
"that which is normal to spatial bodies within a given system."

"When we observe the sky, we expect most objects to appear to move in a "
"particular direction with the passing of time. The apparent motion of most "
"bodies in the sky is from east to west. However it is possible to observe a "
"body moving west to east, such as an artificial satellite or space shuttle "
"that is orbiting eastward. This orbit is considered Retrograde Motion."

"Retrograde Motion is most often used in reference to the motion of the outer"
" planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and so forth). Though these planets appear "
"to move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the spin of the "
"Earth, they are actually drifting slowly eastward with respect to the "
"stationary stars, which can be observed by noting the position of these "
"planets for several nights in a row. This motion is normal for these "
"planets, however, and not considered Retrograde Motion. However, since the "
"Earth completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than these outer "
"planets, we occasionally overtake an outer planet, like a faster car on a "
"multiple-lane highway. When this occurs, the planet we are passing will "
"first appear to stop its eastward drift, and it will then appear to drift "
"back toward the west. This is Retrograde Motion, since it is in a direction "
"opposite that which is typical for planets. Finally, as the Earth swings "
"past the planet in its orbit, they appear to resume their normal west-to-"
"east drift on successive nights."

"This Retrograde Motion of the planets puzzled ancient Greek astronomers, and"
" was one reason why they named these bodies “planets” which in Greek means "
"“wanderers”."
