"The “What's up Tonight?” (WUT) tool displays a list of objects that will be "
"visible at night from any location, on any date. By default, the Date and "
"Location are taken from the current settings in the main window, but you can "
"change either value using the ``Change Date...`` and ``Change Location...`` "
"buttons at the top of the WUT window."

"The WUT tool also displays a short almanac of data for the selected date: "
"the rise and set times for the Sun and moon, the duration of the night, and "
"the Moon's illumination fraction."

"Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed. The objects "
"are organized into type categories. Select an object type in the box labeled "
"``Select a category:``, and all objects of that type which are above the "
"horizon on the selected night will be displayed in the box labeled "
"``Matching objects:``. For example, in the screenshot, the ``Planets`` "
"category has been selected, and three planets which are up on the selected "
"night are displayed (Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). When an object in the list "
"is selected, its rise, set and transit times are displayed in the lower-"
"right panel (i.e. Mars rises at 17:13, transits at 21:46 and sets at 02:16). "
"In addition, you can press the ``Object Details...`` button to open the :ref:"
"`Object Details window <tools-object-details-window>` for that object."

"By default, the WUT will display objects which are above the horizon between "
"sunset and midnight (i.e. “in the evening”). You can choose to show objects "
"which are up between midnight and dawn (“in the morning”), or between dusk "
"and dawn (“any time tonight”) using the combobox near the top of the window. "
"You can also choose to see only those objects that are brighter than a "
"magnitude by setting a minimum magnitude using the ``Show objects brighter "
"than magnitude:`` spinbox. You may center the selected object in the Sky Map "
"or add it to Wish List by pressing the ``Center Object`` or ``Add to List`` "
"button."
