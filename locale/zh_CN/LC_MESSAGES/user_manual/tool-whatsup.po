"The <quote>What's up Tonight?</quote> (WUT) tool displays a list of objects "
"that will be visible at night from any location, on any date. By default, "
"the Date and Location are taken from the current settings in the main "
"window, but you can change either value using the <guibutton>Change Date...</"
"guibutton> and <guibutton>Change Location...</guibutton> buttons at the top "
"of the WUT window."

"Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed. The objects "
"are organized into type categories. Select an object type in the box labeled "
"<guilabel>Select a category:</guilabel>, and all objects of that type which "
"are above the horizon on the selected night will be displayed in the box "
"labeled <guilabel>Matching objects:</guilabel>. For example, in the "
"screenshot, the <guilabel>Planets</guilabel> category has been selected, and "
"three planets which are up on the selected night are displayed (Mars, "
"Jupiter and Saturn). When an object in the list is selected, its rise, set "
"and transit times are displayed in the lower-right panel (&ie; Mars rises at "
"17:13, transits at 21:46 and sets at 02:16). In addition, you can press the "
"<guibutton>Object Details...</guibutton> button to open the <link linkend="
"\"tool-details\">Object Details window</link> for that object."

"the combobox near the top of the window. You can also choose to see only "

"magnitude using the <guilabel>Show objects brighter than magnitude:</"
