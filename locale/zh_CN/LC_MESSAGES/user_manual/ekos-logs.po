"Logging is a very important tool in order to diagnose any issues with either "
"INDI drivers or Ekos. Before submitting any support request, the log must be "
"attached in order to help diagnose the exact issue. Depending on the exact "
"problem, you may need to enable logging for the feature or drivers that "
"exhibit issues. Enabling logging for everything is not recommended as it "
"will produce too much data that would be useful to diagnose the issue and "
"could result in missing the root cause all other. So only enable the "
"necessary logs."
