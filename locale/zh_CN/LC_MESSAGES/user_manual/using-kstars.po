"The above screenshot shows a typical view of the KStars program. You can see"
" the sky display centered on Betelgeuse, the brightest star in the "
"constellation Orion. Stars are displayed with :doc:`realistic colors  <ai-"
"colorandtemp>` and relative brightnesses. In three corners of the sky "
"display, there are on-screen text labels displaying data on the current time"
" (“LT: 3:08:30 AM EEST Wednesday, July 6, 2016”), the current Geographic "
"Location (“Bucharest, Romania”), and the current object in the center of the"
" display (“Focused on: Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis)”). Above the sky display, "
"there are two toolbars. The main toolbar contains shortcuts for :doc:`menu "
"functions  <kstars-menu>`, as well as a time-step widget which controls how "
"fast the simulation clock runs. The view toolbar contains buttons that "
"toggle the display of different kinds of objects in the sky. At the bottom "
"of the window, there is a status bar which displays the name of any object "
"you click on, and the :doc:`sky coordinates  <ai-skycoords>` (both Right "
"Ascension/Declination and Azimuth/Altitude) of the mouse cursor."
