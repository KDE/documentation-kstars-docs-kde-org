"KStars lets you explore the night sky from the comfort of your computer "
"chair. It provides an accurate graphical representation of the night sky for "
"any date, from any location on Earth. The display includes 126,000 stars to "
"9th magnitude (100 million with addon catalogs), 13,000 deep-sky objects "
"(Messier, NGC, and IC catalogs), all planets, the Sun and Moon, hundreds of "
"comets and asteroids, the Milky Way, 88 constellations, and guide lines such "
"as the :doc:`celestial equator  <ai-cequator>`, the :doc:`horizon  <ai-"
"horizon>` and the :doc:`ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`."

"However, KStars is more than a simple night-sky simulator. The display "
"provides a compelling interface to a number of tools with which you can "
"learn more about astronomy and the night sky. There is a context-sensitive :"
"ref:`popup menu  <commands-popup-menu>` attached to each displayed object, "
"which displays object-specific information and actions.  Hundreds of objects "
"provide links in their popup menus to informative web pages and beautiful "
"images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories."

"From an object's popup menu, you can open its :ref:`Detailed Information "
"Window  <tools-object-details-window>`, where you can examine positional "
"data about the object, and query a huge treasury of online databases for "
"professional-grade astronomical data and literature references about the "
"object.  You can even attach your own Internet links, images and text notes, "
"making KStars a graphical front-end to your observing logs and your personal "
"astronomical notebook."

"You can plan an observing session using our :doc:`Altitude vs.  Time  <tool-"
"altvstime>` tool, which will plot curves representing the Altitude as a "
"function of time for any group of objects. If that is too much detail, we "
"also provide a :doc:`What's up Tonight?  <tool-whatsup>` tool that "
"summarizes the objects that you will be able to see from your location on "
"any given night. You can add your favorite objects to your observing wish-"
"list using the :doc:`Observation Planner  <tool-obsplanner>` tool, which "
"allows you to plan your observation sessions professionally. To see how "
"object appears in the eyepiece under different telescopes and field of "
"views, use the :doc:`Simulate Eyepiece View  <tool-eyepieceview>` tool to "
"render a simulated view of what you see."

"Our primary goal is to make KStars an interactive educational tool for "
"learning about astronomy and the night sky. To this end, the KStars Handbook "
"includes the :doc:`AstroInfo Project  <astroinfo>`, a series of short, "
"hyperlinked articles on astronomical topics that can be explored with "
"KStars. In addition, KStars includes D-Bus functions that allow you to :doc:"
"`write complex scripts  <tool-scriptbuilder>`, making KStars a powerful "
"“demo engine” for classroom use or general illustration of astronomical "
"topics. Furthermore, any 3rd party tool or language with support of D-Bus "
"can be used to write powerful scripts using `KStars D-Bus API <https://api."
"kde.org/appscomplete-api/kstars-apidocs/kstars/html/classKStars.html>`__."

"Enable :doc:`HiPS all-sky progressive overlay  <hips>` to fetch high-"
"resolution images and display them directly in the sky map. You can select "
"from numerous catalogs compiled from different earth and space based "
"missions. This features requires a fast internet connection in order to "
"download the images. The images are cached locally to reduce bandwidth. You "
"can optimize the caching options to best balance between disk space versus "

"KStars is also for astrophotographers. You can control telescopes and "
"cameras using the elegant and powerful :doc:`INDI  <indi>` protocol. Ekos "
"supports many popular telescopes including Meade's LX200 family and "
"Celestron GPS.  Many popular CCD, CMOS and DSLR astrophotography cameras, "
"webcams, and computerized focusers are also supported. Simple slew/track "
"commands are integrated directly into the skymap's popup menu, and the INDI "
"Control Panel provides full access to all of your telescope's functions. "
"INDI's Client/Server architecture allows for seamless control of any number "
"of :ref:`local  <indi-indi-setup>` or :doc:`remote  <indi-remote-control>` "
"telescopes using a single KStars session. For advanced users, KStars "
"provides Ekos, a complete astrophotography suite for Linux, Mac and "
"Windows.  `Ekos <https://indilib.org/about/ekos.html>`__ is based on a "
"modular extensible framework to perform common astrophotography tasks. This "
"includes highly accurate GOTOs using astrometry solver, ability to measure "
"and correct polar alignment errors , auto-focus and auto-guide capabilities, "
"and capture of single or stack of images with filter wheel, rotator and dome "
"support.  Complex jobs can be scheduled and run automatically with the Ekos "
"scheduler, taking into account priority, altitude, terrain, moon and "
"twilight constraints. You can view the progress of a night's "
"astrophotography session using the Ekos Analyze module, and view the images "
"captured using the FITS Viewer. Ekos is described in :doc:`Chapter 5.  "
"<ekos>`"
