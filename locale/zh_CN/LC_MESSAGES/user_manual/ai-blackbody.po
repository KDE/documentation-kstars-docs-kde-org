"A *blackbody* refers to an opaque object that emits *thermal radiation*. A "
"perfect blackbody is one that absorbs all incoming light and does not "
"reflect any. At room temperature, such an object would appear to be "
"perfectly black (hence the term *blackbody*). However, if heated to a high "
"temperature, a blackbody will begin to glow with *thermal radiation*."

"In fact, all objects emit thermal radiation (as long as their temperature is "
"above Absolute Zero, or -273.15 degrees Celsius), but no object emits "
"thermal radiation perfectly; rather, they are better at emitting/absorbing "
"some wavelengths of light than others. These uneven efficiencies make it "
"difficult to study the interaction of light, heat and matter using normal "
"objects."

"Fortunately, it is possible to construct a nearly-perfect blackbody. "
"Construct a box made of a thermally conductive material, such as metal. The "
"box should be completely closed on all sides, so that the inside forms a "
"cavity that does not receive light from the surroundings. Then, make a small "
"hole somewhere on the box. The light coming out of this hole will almost "
"perfectly resemble the light from an ideal blackbody, for the temperature of "
"the air inside the box."

"At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists Lord Rayleigh, and Max "
"Planck (among others) studied the blackbody radiation using such a device. "
"After much work, Planck was able to empirically describe the intensity of "
"light emitted by a blackbody as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, he "
"was able to describe how this spectrum would change as the temperature "
"changed. Planck's work on blackbody radiation is one of the areas of physics "
"that led to the foundation of the wonderful science of Quantum Mechanics, "
"but that is unfortunately beyond the scope of this article."

"What Planck and the others found was that as the temperature of a blackbody "
"increases, the total amount of light emitted per second increases, and the "
"wavelength of the spectrum's peak shifts to bluer colors (see Figure 1)."

"where T is the temperature in Kelvin. Wien's law (also known as Wien's "
"displacement law) states that the wavelength of maximum emission from a "
"blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. This makes sense; "
"shorter-wavelength (higher-frequency) light corresponds to higher-energy "
"photons, which you would expect from a higher-temperature object."
