"object and may be shared by several objects of different catalogs."

"Currently, deduplication (the assignment of OIDs) is only supported by the "

"reproducibly build catalogs in a homogeneous environment. Every catalog is "
"implemented `as a python module <https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-"
"catalogs/-/blob/master/catalogs/sharpless_2.py>`__ and provides standard "
"methods to acquire data, parse it and find duplicates in other catalogs. All "
"downloadable catalogs are implemented this way. If you'd like to make a "
"catalog of your own available for KStars, it is recommended that you "
"implement it as a package in the repository. The tooling provided there is "
"so flexible, that it should work for you. For more information on how to do "
"that see the `catalog repository documentation <https://protagon.space/"
"catalogs/>`__. If you are not familiar with python programming you can "
"request the addition of a catalog by opening a ticket in the repository or "
"contacting `the maintainers <https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-"
"catalogs/-/project_members>`__. KStars provides also provides means to "
"create custom catalogs by manually entering data or importing CSV tables, "
