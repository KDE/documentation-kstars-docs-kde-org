"You can use KStars to generate an image of the sky without actually "
"launching the GUI portion of the program. To use this feature, start KStars "
"from a command prompt using arguments to specify the filename for the image, "
"as well as the desired image dimensions:"

"If no filename is specified, it generates a file named ``kstars.png``. It "
"will attempt to generate an image that matches the extension of your "
"filename. The following extensions are recognized: “png”, “jpg”, “jpeg”, "
"“gif”, “pnm”, and “bmp”. If the filename extension is not recognized, it "
"defaults to the PNG image type."

"By default, KStars will read in the options values stored in your ``$KDEHOME/"
"share/config/kstarsrc`` file to determine where the image will be centered, "
"and how it is rendered. This means you need to run KStars in normal GUI "
"mode, and exit the program when it is set up with the desired options for "
"the generated images. This is not very flexible, so we also provide the "
"ability to execute a KStars D-Bus script to set the scene before generating "
"the image. The filename you specify as the script argument should be a valid "
"KStars D-Bus script, such as one created with the :doc:`Script Builder Tool "
"<tool-scriptbuilder>`. The script can be used to set where the image is "
"pointing, set the geographic location, set the time and date, change the "
"Zoom level, and adjust other view options. Some of the D-Bus functions make "
"no sense in non-GUI mode (such as ``waitForKey()``); if these functions are "
"encountered while parsing the script, they are simply ignored."

"By default, KStars will use the system CPU time and date for generating the "
"image. Alternatively, you may specify a time and date with the “--date” "
"argument. You can also use this argument for specifying the startup date in "
"normal GUI mode."
