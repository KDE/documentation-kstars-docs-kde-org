"KStars displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets, comets, "
"asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies. You can interact with displayed "
"objects to perform actions on them or obtain more information about them. "
"Clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar, and simply "
"hovering the mouse cursor on an object will label it temporarily in the map. "
"Double-clicking will recenter the display on the object and begin tracking "
"it (so that it will remain centered as time passes). Right clicking an "
"object opens the object's popup menu, which provides more options."

"KStars provides another method for resolving the objects that are missing "
"from any of its predefined catalogues, by using an internet connection. "
"Thus, if you want to find an object that KStars is not aware of, you can "
"easily do this by querying several professional astronomical databases as: "
"SIMBAD, NED or VizieR. This can be done by entering the object's name and "
"then press the ``or search the internet`` for `ObjectName` button. After "
"your object is found, you can use it exactly as any object that is already "
"loaded into KStars (i.e. adding it to the Observing WishList). If the object "
"was not found in the online databases, then a warning dialogue will pop-up. "
"Once you resolve an object by using this method, it is stored in KStars "
"database, so if you close KStars and open it again, your object will still "
"be there."

"You can choose to enable or disable this feature by checking or unchecking "
"the ``Resolve names not known to KStars`` using online services check box "

"``Settings`` → ``Configure KStars...`` menu item). If this checkbox is "
"checked, when an object name unknown to KStars is entered in the ``Find "
"Dialog``, KStars will contact online services to learn about the desired "
"object and then add it directly to KStars database. The objects acquired in "
"this manner are stored in a fake catalog, called “\\_Internet_Resolved”. "
"Thus, you can enable or disable the display of these objects by checking or "
"unchecking the “\\_Internet_Resolved” catalog from the catalogues list. Note "
"that you can not delete this fake catalogue, as you can do with a custom "
"catalogue. If this checkbox is unchecked, then the ``Find Object`` window "
"will be exactly the same, excepting a minor change: the online searching "
"button will no longer be visible."
