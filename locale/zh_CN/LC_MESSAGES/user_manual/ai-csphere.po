"The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius, centered on "
"the Earth. All objects which can be seen in the sky can be thought of as "
"lying on the surface of this sphere."

"Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a "
"sphere centered on the Earth, so why bother with such a construct? "
"Everything we see in the sky is so very far away, that their distances are "
"impossible to gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are "
"indeterminate, you only need to know the *direction* toward the object to "
"locate it in the sky. In this sense, the celestial sphere model is a very "
"practical model for mapping the sky."
