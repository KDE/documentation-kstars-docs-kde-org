"Toggle whether the Info Boxes are drawn in the ``Settings`` → ``Info Boxes``"
" submenu. In addition, you can manipulate the three Info Boxes with the "
"mouse. Each box has additional lines of data that are hidden by default. You"
" can toggle whether these additional lines are visible by double-clicking a "
"box to “shade” it. Also, you can reposition a box by dragging it with the "
"mouse. When a box hits a window edge, it will “stick” to the edge when the "
"window is resized."

"Choose an “FOV Symbol” using the ``Settings`` → ``FOV Symbols`` submenu. "
"*FOV* is an acronym for “field-of-view”. An FOV symbol is drawn at the "
"center of the window to indicate where the display is pointing. Different "
"symbols have different angular sizes; you can use a symbol to show what the "
"view through a particular telescope would look like. For example, if you "
"choose the “7x35 Binoculars” FOV symbol, then a circle is drawn on the "
"display that is 9.2 degrees in diameter; this is the field-of-view for 7x35 "
"binoculars."

"This window lets you modify the four properties that define a FOV symbol: "
"name, size, shape, and color. The angular size for the symbol can either be "
"entered directly in the ``Field of View`` edit box, or you can use the "
"Eyepiece/Camera Tabs to calculate the field-of-view angle, given parameters "
"of your telescope/eyepiece or telescope/camera setup. The five available "
"shapes are: Square, Circle, Crosshairs, Bullseye and Semitransparent circle."
" Once you have specified all four parameters, press ``Ok``, and the symbol "
"will appear in the list of defined symbols. It will also be available from "
"the ``Settings`` → ``FOV Symbols`` submenu."
