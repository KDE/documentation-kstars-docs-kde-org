"The Ekos Alignment Module enables highly accurate GOTOs and can measure and "
"correct polar alignment errors. This is possible thanks to third-party plate-"
"solving technology. The main plate-solving software used is the "
"StellarSolver package, which itself makes use of the offline (and online) "
"astrometry.net, ASTAP and Watney solvers. Ekos begins by capturing an image "
"of a star field, feeding that image to the chosen solver (e.g. see "
"`astrometry.net <https://astrometry.net>`__, `StellarSolver <https://"
"github.com/rlancaste/stellarsolver>`__ or `ASTAP <https://www.hnsky.org/"
"astap>`__), and gets in return the central coordinates (RA, DEC), scale, and "
"orientation of the image. The solver essentially performs pattern "
"recognition against a catalog of millions of stars.  Once the coordinates "
"are determined, the true pointing of the telescope is known."

msgid ""
"Often, there is a discrepancy between where the telescope thinks it is "
"looking at and where it is truly pointing. The magnitude of this discrepancy "
"can range from a few arcminutes to a couple of degrees. Ekos can correct the "
"discrepancy by syncing to the new coordinates, and then slewing the mount to "
"the desired target originally requested."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/ekos-align.rst:16
msgid ""
"Ekos also provides a Polar Alignment Assistant Tool to correct polar "
"alignment errors. It takes three images, slewing between the images, and "
"calculates the offset between the mount axis and polar axis. It feeds back "
"to the user the altitude and azimuth adjustments needed to align these axes. "
"These images are typically taken near the celestial pole (close to Polaris "
"for Northern Hemisphere) but can work well taken from anywhere, usually "
"starting near the meridian and slewing either East or West."
