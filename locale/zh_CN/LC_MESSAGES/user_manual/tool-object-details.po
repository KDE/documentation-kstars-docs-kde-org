"Link...`` button. This will open a window in which you fill in the URL and "
"link text for the new link (you can also test the URL in the web browser "

"are able to choose the resource type using the ``Resource Type`` button. "
"Keep in mind that the custom link can easily point to a file on your local "
"disk, so you can use this feature to index your personal astronomical images"
" or observing logs."
