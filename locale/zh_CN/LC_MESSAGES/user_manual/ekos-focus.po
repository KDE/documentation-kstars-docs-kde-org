"In order to focus an image, Ekos needs to establish a numerical method for "
"gauging how *good* your focus is. It's easy when you look at an image and "
"can see it as *unfocused*, as the human eye is very good at detecting that, "
"but *how* can Ekos possibly know that?"

msgid ""
"The most tried and tested method is Half-Flux-Radius (HFR), which is a "
"measure of the width in pixels counting from the center of the star until "
"the accumulated intensity is half of the total flux of the star. As you move "
"closer to the point of optimum focus, so the HFR gets smaller, reaching a "
"minimum at the point of focus before increasing as you start to move away "
"from focus. HFR has been used on lots of different types of equipment and "
"has proved to be stable in a wide range of circumstances."
msgstr ""

"In addition to HFR, Ekos supports other focus measures, including an "

"After Ekos processes an image, it selects either a single star and starts "
"measuring its HFR, or it selects a set of stars matching the criteria that "
"have been set and calculates an average HFR. It can automatically select "

"Ekos to select a set of stars."

"**Linear**: In the Linear algorithm, Ekos steps outward from its starting "
"point then moves inward taking regular datapoints through the point of "
"optimum focus and then further inward, to draw a V-Curve. It then fits a "
"quadratic curve to the datapoints and calculates the point of optimum focus. "
"It then moves out again past the point of optimum focus, halves the stepsize "
"and moves in again for a second pass. It looks to follow the curve from the "
"first pass and find the minimum HFR. Due to randomness in the HFR "
"measurements it uses the % tolerance to help decide when it has found a "
"solution. Key features include:"

"If the focuser behaves in an inconsistent way, i.e.  when commanded to go to "

"variability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/ekos-focus.rst:46
msgid ""
"**Iterative**: In the Iterative algorithm, Ekos operates iteratively by "
"moving in discrete steps, decided initially by the user-configurable step "
"size and later by the slope of the V-Curve, to get closer to the optimal "
"focus position where it then changes gears and performs smaller, finer moves "
"to reach the optimal focus. The focus process stops when the measured HFR is "
"within the configurable tolerance of the minimum recorded HFR in the "
"process. In other words, whenever the process starts searching for a "
"solution within a narrowly limited range, it checks if the current HFR is "
"within % difference compared to the minimum HFR recorded, and if this "
"condition is met then the Autofocus process is considered successful.  The "
"default value is set to 1% and is sufficient for most situations. The Step "
"options specify the number of initial ticks the focuser has to move. If the "
"image is severely out of focus, we set the step size high (i.e. greater than "
"250). On the other hand, if the focus is close to optimal focus, we set the "
"step size to a more reasonable range (less than 50). It takes trial and "
"error to find the best starting tick, but Ekos only uses that for the first "
"focus motion, as all subsequent motions depend on the V-Curve slope "
"calculations. Key features include:"
