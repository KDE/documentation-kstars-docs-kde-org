"Astronomers use flux to denote the apparent brightness of a celestial body. "
"The apparent brightness is defined as the amount of light received from a "
"star above the earth atmosphere passing through a unit area each second. "
"Therefore, the apparent brightness is simply the flux we receive from a star."

"The flux measures the *rate of flow* of energy that passes through each "
"cm\\ :sup:`2` (or any unit area) of an object's surface each second. The "
"detected flux depends on the distance from the source that radiates the "
"energy. This is because the energy has to spread over a volume of space "
"before it reaches us. Let us assume that we have an imaginary balloon that "
"encloses a star. Each dot on the balloon represents a unit of energy emitted "
"from the star. Initially, the dots in an area of one cm\\ :sup:`2` are in "
"close proximity to each other and the flux (energy emitted per square "
"centimeter per second) is high. After a distance d, the volume and surface "
"area of the balloon increased causing the dots to *spread away* from each. "
"Consequently, the number of dots (or energy) enclosed in one cm\\ :sup:`2` "
"has decreased as illustrated in Figure 1."

"The flux is inversely proportional to distance by a simple r\\ :sup:`2` "
"relation. Therefore, if the distance is doubled, we receive 1/2\\ :sup:`2` "
"or 1/4th of the original flux. From a fundamental standpoint, the flux is "
"the :doc:`luminosity  <ai-luminosity>` per unit area:"

"where (4 \\* Ï€ \\* R\\ :sup:`2`) is the surface area of a sphere (or a "

"commonly used by astronomers: Ergs/cm\\ :sup:`2`/s. For example, the "
