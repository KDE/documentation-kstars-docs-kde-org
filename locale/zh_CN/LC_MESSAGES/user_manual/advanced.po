"The ``Correct for atmospheric refraction`` checkbox controls whether the "
"positions of objects are corrected for the effects of the atmosphere. "
"Because the atmosphere is a spherical shell, light from outer space is "
"“bent” as it passes through the atmosphere to our telescopes or eyes on the "
"Earth's surface. The effect is largest for objects near the horizon, and "
"actually changes the predicted rise or set times of objects by a few "
"minutes. In fact, when you “see” a sunset, the Sun's actual position is "
"already well below the horizon; atmospheric refraction makes it seem as if "
"the Sun is still in the sky. Note that atmospheric refraction is never "
"applied if you are using ``Equatorial coordinates``."

"The ``Use animated slewing`` checkbox controls how the display changes when "
"a new focus position is selected in the map. By default, you will see the "
"sky drift or “slew” to the new position; if you uncheck this option, then "
"the display will instead “snap” immediately to the new focus position."

"If the ``Attach label to centered object`` checkbox is selected, then a name "
"label will automatically be attached to an object when it is being tracked "
"by the program. The label will be removed when the object is no longer being "
"tracked. Note that you can also manually attach a persistent name label to "
"any object with its :ref:`popup menu  <commands-popup-menu>`."

"There are three situations when KStars must redraw the sky display very "
"rapidly: when a new focus position is selected (and ``Use animated slewing`` "
"is checked), when the sky is dragged with the mouse, and when the time step "
"is large. In these situations, the positions of all objects must be "
"recomputed as rapidly as possible, which can put a large load on the CPU. If "
"the CPU cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish "
"or jerky. To mitigate this, KStars will hide certain objects during these "
"rapid-redraw situations, as long as the ``Hide objects while moving`` "
"checkbox is selected. The timestep threshold above which objects will be "
"hidden is determined by the ``Also hide if time step larger than:`` timestep-"
"spinbox. You can specify the objects that should be hidden in the "
"``Configure Hidden Objects`` section."
