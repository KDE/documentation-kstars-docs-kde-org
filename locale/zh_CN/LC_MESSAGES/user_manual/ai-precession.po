"*Precession* is the gradual change in the direction of the Earth's spin "
"axis. The spin axis traces a cone, completing a full circuit in 26,000 "
"years. If you have ever spun a top or a dreidel, the “wobbling” rotation of "
"the top as it spins is precession."

"Because the direction of the Earth's spin axis changes, so does the location "
"of the :doc:`Celestial Poles  <ai-cpoles>`."

"The reason for the Earth's precession is complicated. The Earth is not a "
"perfect sphere, it is a bit flattened, meaning the :doc:`Great Circle  <ai-"
"greatcircle>` of the equator is longer than a “meridonal” great circle that "
"passes through the poles. Also, the Moon and Sun lie outside the Earth's "
"Equatorial plane. As a result, the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun on "
"the oblate Earth induces a slight *torque* in addition to a linear force. "
"This torque on the spinning body of the Earth leads to the precessional "
"motion."

"Precession is easiest to see by observing the :doc:`Celestial Pole  <ai-"
"cpoles>`. To find the pole, first switch to Equatorial Coordinates in the "
"``Configure - KStars`` window, and then hold down the **Up** arrow key until "
"the display stops scrolling. The declination displayed in the center of the "
"Info Panel should be +90 degrees, and the bright star Polaris should be "
"nearly at the center of the screen. Try slewing with the left and right "
"arrow keys. Notice that the sky appears to rotate around the Pole."

"We will now demonstrate Precession by changing the Date to a very remote "
"year, and observing that the location of the Celestial Pole is no longer "
"near Polaris. Open the ``Set Time`` window (**Ctrl**\\ +\\ **S**), and set "
"the date to the year 8000 (currently, KStars cannot handle dates much more "
"remote than this, but this date is sufficient for our purposes). Notice that "
"the sky display is now centered at a point between the constellations Cygnus "
"and Cepheus. Verify that this is actually the pole by slewing left and "
"right: the sky rotates about this point; in the year 8000, the North "
"celestial pole will no longer be near Polaris."
