"This tool plots the altitude of any objects as a function of time, for any "
"date and location on Earth. The top section is a graphical plot of altitude "
"angle on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal axis. The time is "
"shown both as standard local time along the bottom, and :doc:`sidereal time  "
"<ai-sidereal>` along the top. The bottom half of the graph is shaded green "
"to indicate that points in this region are below the horizon."

"There are a few ways to add curves to the plot. The simplest way to add the "
"curve of an existing object is to simply type its name in the ``Name:`` "
"input field, and press Enter, or the ``Plot`` button. If the text you enter "
"is found in the object database, the object's curve is added to the graph. "
"You can also press the ``Find Object...`` button to open the :ref:`Find "
"Object Window  <skyobjects-finding-objects>` to select an object from the "
"list of known objects. If you want to add a point that does not exist in the "
"object database, simply enter a name for the point, and then fill in the "
"coordinates in the ``RA:`` and ``Dec:`` input fields. Then press the "
"``Plot`` button to add the curve for your custom object to the plot (note "
"that you have to pick a name that does not already exist in the object "
"database for this to work)."

"When you add an object to the plot, its altitude vs. time curve is plotted "
"with a thick white line, and its name is added to the listbox at the lower "
"right. Any objects that were already present are plotted with a thinner red "
"curve. You can choose which object is plotted with the thick white curve by "
"highlighting its name in the listbox."

"These curves show the objects' Altitude (angle above the :doc:`horizon  <ai-"
"horizon>`) as a function of time. When a curve passes from the lower half to "
"the upper half, the object has risen; when it falls back to the lower half, "
"it has set. For example, in the screenshot, the minor planet *Quaoar* is "
"setting at around 15:00 local time, and is rising at about 04:00 local time."

"The plot can be easily zoomed and panned using the mouse. The zooming level "
"can be adjusted using the mouse scroll wheel. When the plot is zoomed out, "
"the zooming level will be automatically limited to a default minimum value, "
"such as the axes’ ranges are able to cover the entire plot (i.e. on vertical "
"axis, the maximum altitude value should touch the top edge of the plot "
"frame). The same principle is applied when the plot is panned using the "
"mouse movement. For panning the plot, all you need to do is to click on the "
"point of the plot you want to pan and then drag the mouse on your desired "
"direction: left, right, up or down."

"Another useful feature that Altvstime tool provides is its ability to "
"compute and mark the Rise/Set/Transit times. This can be accomplished by a "
"simple press of one of the ``Rise``, ``Set`` or ``Transit`` buttons. When "
"one of these buttons is pressed, a filled colored circle will be marked on "
"the curve. The color used for Rise, Set and Transit dots are: red for Rise, "
"blue for Set and green for Transit time. For a more intuitive way of using "
"these buttons, they are marked with the color of their specific dots. This "
"way, the user can easily understand the plot and make the association "
"between a certain color and its significance."

"Altvstime tool provides an easy way to find out the altitude of a sky-object "
"at a certain moment of time using the ``Compute`` button. After you select "
"the object from the Objects list and set the moment of time, the altitude "
"can be computed by pressing the ``Compute`` button. But this is not the only "
"way you can find out the altitude. Another method is to hover with mouse "
"above one curve and thus, a tooltip containing the Local Time, Local "
"Sidereal Time and Altitude will come up. This way, you can read the "
"information in real time."

"The Altitude of an object depends on both where you are on Earth, and on the "
"Date. By default, the Tool adopts the Location and Date from the current "
"KStars settings. You can change these parameters in the ``Date & Location`` "
"Tab. To change the Location, you can press the ``Choose City...`` button to "
"open the :doc:`Set Geographic Location  <config-setgeo>` Window, or enter "
"Longitude and Latitude values manually in the input fields, and press the "
"``Update`` button. To change the Date, use the spin and combo boxes, then "
"press ``Update``. Note that any curves you had already plotted will be "
"automatically updated when you change the Date and/or Location."

"Plot the Sun's Altitude curve. Make sure the geographic location is not near "
"the equator. Change the Date to some time in June, and then again to "
"sometime in January. You can see easily why we have seasons; in the winter, "
"the Sun is above the horizon for less time (the days are shorter), and its "
"altitude is never very high."
