"This tool plots the altitude of any objects as a function of time, for any "
"date and location on Earth. The top section is a graphical plot of altitude "
"angle on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal axis. The time is "
"shown both as standard local time along the bottom, and <link linkend=\"ai-"
"sidereal\">sidereal time</link> along the top. The bottom half of the graph "
"is shaded green to indicate that points in this region are below the horizon."

"There are a few ways to add curves to the plot. The simplest way to add the "
"curve of an existing object is to simply type its name in the <guilabel>Name:"
"</guilabel> input field, and press Enter, or the <guibutton>Plot</guibutton> "
"button. If the text you enter is found in the object database, the object's "
"curve is added to the graph. You can also press the <guibutton>Find Object..."
"</guibutton> button to open the <link linkend=\"findobjects\">Find Object "
"Window</link> to select an object from the list of known objects. If you "
"want to add a point that does not exist in the object database, simply enter "
"a name for the point, and then fill in the coordinates in the <guilabel>RA:</"
"guilabel> and <guilabel>Dec:</guilabel> input fields. Then press the "
"<guibutton>Plot</guibutton> button to add the curve for your custom object "
"to the plot (note that you have to pick a name that does not already exist "
"in the object database for this to work)."

"When you add an object to the plot, its altitude vs. time curve is plotted "
"with a thick white line, and its name is added to the listbox at the lower "
"right. Any objects that were already present are plotted with a thinner red "
"curve. You can choose which object is plotted with the thick white curve by "
"highlighting its name in the listbox."

"These curves show the objects' Altitude (angle above the <link linkend=\"ai-"
"horizon\">horizon</link>) as a function of time. When a curve passes from "
"the lower half to the upper half, the object has risen; when it falls back "
"to the lower half, it has set. For example, in the screenshot, the minor "
"planet <firstterm>Quaoar</firstterm> is setting at around 15:00 local time, "
"and is rising at about 04:00 local time."

"The plot can be easily zoomed and panned using the mouse. The zooming level "
"can be adjusted using the mouse scroll <mousebutton>wheel</mousebutton>. "
"When the plot is zoomed out, the zooming level will be automatically limited "
"to a default minimum value, such as the axes’ ranges are able to cover the "
"entire plot (i.e. on vertical axis, the maximum altitude value should touch "
"the top edge of the plot frame). The same principle is applied when the plot "
"is panned using the mouse movement. For panning the plot, all you need to do "
"is to click on the point of the plot you want to pan and then drag the mouse "
"on your desired direction: left, right, up or down."

"Another useful feature that Altvstime tool provides is its ability to "
"compute and mark the Rise/Set/Transit times. This can be accomplished by a "
"simple press of one of the <guibutton>Rise</guibutton>, <guibutton>Set</"
"guibutton> or <guibutton>Transit</guibutton> buttons. When one of these "
"buttons is pressed, a filled colored circle will be marked on the curve. The "
"color used for Rise, Set and Transit dots are: red for Rise, blue for Set "
"and green for Transit time. For a more intuitive way of using these buttons, "
"they are marked with the color of their specific dots. This way, the user "
"can easily understand the plot and make the association between a certain "
"color and its significance."

"Altvstime tool provides an easy way to find out the altitude of a sky-object "
"at a certain moment of time using the <guibutton>Compute</guibutton> button. "
"After you select the object from the Objects list and set the moment of "
"time, the altitude can be computed by pressing the <guibutton>Compute</"
"guibutton> button. But this is not the only way you can find out the "
"altitude. Another method is to hover with mouse above one curve and thus, a "
"tooltip containing the Local Time, Local Sidereal Time and Altitude will "
"come up. This way, you can read the information in real time."

"The Altitude of an object depends on both where you are on Earth, and on the "
"Date. By default, the Tool adopts the Location and Date from the current "
"&kstars; settings. You can change these parameters in the <guilabel>Date "
"&amp; Location</guilabel> Tab. To change the Location, you can press the "
"<guibutton>Choose City...</guibutton> button to open the <link linkend="
"\"setgeo\">Set Geographic Location</link> Window, or enter Longitude and "
"Latitude values manually in the input fields, and press the "
"<guibutton>Update</guibutton> button. To change the Date, use the spin and "
"combo boxes, then press <guibutton>Update</guibutton>. Note that any curves "
"you had already plotted will be automatically updated when you change the "
"Date and/or Location."

"Plot the Sun's Altitude curve. Make sure the geographic location is not near "
"the equator. Change the Date to some time in June, and then again to "
"sometime in January. You can see easily why we have seasons; in the winter, "
"the Sun is above the horizon for less time (the days are shorter), and its "
