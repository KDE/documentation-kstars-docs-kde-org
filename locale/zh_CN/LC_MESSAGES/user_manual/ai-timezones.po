"The Earth is round, and it is always half-illuminated by the Sun. However, "
"because the Earth is spinning, the half that is illuminated is always "
"changing. We experience this as the passing of days wherever we are on the "
"Earth's surface. At any given instant, there are places on the Earth passing "
"from the dark half into the illuminated half (which is seen as "
"<emphasis>dawn</emphasis> on the surface). At the same instant, on the "
"opposite side of the Earth, points are passing from the illuminated half "
"into darkness (which is seen as <emphasis>dusk</emphasis> at those "
"locations). So, at any given time, different places on Earth are "
"experiencing different parts of the day. Thus, Solar time is defined "
"locally, so that the clock time at any location describes the part of the "
"day consistently."

"This localization of time is accomplished by dividing the globe into 24 "
"vertical slices called <firstterm>Time Zones</firstterm>. The Local Time is "
"the same within any given zone, but the time in each zone is one Hour "
"<emphasis>earlier</emphasis> than the time in the neighboring Zone to the "
"East. Actually, this is an idealized simplification; real Time Zone "
"boundaries are not straight vertical lines, because they often follow "
"national boundaries and other political considerations."

"Note that because the Local Time always increases by an hour when moving "
"between Zones to the East, by the time you move through all 24 Time Zones, "
"you are a full day ahead of where you started. We deal with this paradox by "
"defining the <firstterm>International Date Line</firstterm>, which is a Time "
"Zone boundary in the Pacific Ocean, between Asia and North America. Points "
"just to the East of this line are 24 hours behind the points just to the "
"West of the line. This leads to some interesting phenomena. A direct flight "
"from Australia to California arrives before it departs. Also, the islands of "
"Fiji straddle the International Date Line, so if you have a bad day on the "
"West side of Fiji, you can go over to the East side of Fiji and have a "
"chance to live the same day all over again."
