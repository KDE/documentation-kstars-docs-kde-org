"The 3D data visualization tool can plot 3D graphs of the selected region of "
"the image. This is particularly useful for astrophotographers who want to "
"visualize the profile of a star they are considering focusing or guiding on. "
"For scientists, it enables them to examine a cross-section of the data to "
"understand the relative brightness of different objects in the image. "
"Additionally, it empowers imagers who want to visually see what is going on "
"in their data collection in a new way."

"To use the new feature, the user needs to select the ``View Star Profile`` "
"icon in one of the Ekos Module Views, or in the FITS Viewer. Then, the "
"region selected in the green tracking box will show up in the 3D graph as "
"shown above. The user will then have one of the following toolbars at the "
"bottom."

"At the far left, the sample size combo box will let the user select the size "
"of the image crop shown in the graph. This option is only available in the "
"``Summary Screen``, the :doc:`Align Module <ekos-align>`, and the FITS "
"Viewer. The second combo box lets the user control whether they are "
"selecting an individual item, or a row, or a column of pixels. The slice "
"button will be enabled if the user selects ``Row`` or ``Column``. It will "
"put the graph in slice mode so that the user can see a cross-section view of "
"the image. Third, is a checkbox that will open up two sliders that will let "
"the user drag the slider to change the selection. This is extremely useful "
"in the slide mode to change the selected point and to move the cross section "
"around the graph. It is also useful in the normal view when in ``Explore "
"Mode`` so that the user can zoom around the image examining the pixels."

"Then the user has the ``Zoom To`` combo box, which the user can use to zoom "
"the graph to different preset locations. Next is the combo box that lets the "
"user select the color scheme of the graph. Then are the HFR and the Peak "
"checkboxes, which will both turn on the HFR and Peak labels on each found "
"star in the image, but will also display one of them at the bottom of the "
"screen. And finally comes the Scaling checkbox, which enables the "
"``Scaling`` Side Panel. There are three sliders in that panel, one to "
"control the minimum value displayed on the graph or “black point”, one to "
"control the maximum value displayed in the graph or the “white point”, and a "
"third that is disabled by default that lets the user control the cutoff "
"value for data displayed on the graph."

"This third slider is very useful to get really big peaks out of the way so "
"you can study the finer details in the image. There is a checkbox at the top "
"to enable/disable the cutoff slider. And finally at the bottom of the "
"sliders is the ``Auto scale`` button. This will auto scale the sliders as "
"you sample different areas in the image. It will not only optimize the "
"display of the data but will also affect the minimum and maximum points of "
"the slider. If you disable auto scale, then as you sample different parts of "
"the image, they will be displayed at the same scale. A particularly useful "
"way to use this is to select an area of your image using auto scale, tweak "
"the min, max, and cutoff sliders to your liking, and then turn off the auto "
"scale feature to explore other areas of the graph."
