"The :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` and the :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-"
"ecliptic>` are two :doc:`Great Circles  <ai-greatcircle>` on "
"the :doc:`Celestial Sphere  <ai-csphere>`, set at an angle of 23.5 degrees. "
"The two points where they intersect are called the *Equinoxes*. The *Vernal "
"Equinox* has coordinates RA=0.0 hours, Dec=0.0 degrees. The *Autumnal "
"Equinox* has coordinates RA=12.0 hours, Dec=0.0 degrees."

"The Equinoxes are important for marking the seasons. Because they are on "
"the :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`, the Sun passes through each equinox "
"every year. When the Sun passes through the Vernal Equinox (usually on March "
"21st), it crosses the :doc:`Celestial Equator  <ai-cequator>` from South to "
"North, signifying the end of Winter for the Northern hemisphere. Similarly, "
"when the Sun passes through the Autumnal Equinox (usually on September "
"21st), it crosses the Celestial Equator from North to South, signifying the "
"end of Winter for the Southern hemisphere."
