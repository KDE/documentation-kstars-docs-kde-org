"The ecliptic is an imaginary <link linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">Great Circle</"
"link> on the <link linkend=\"ai-csphere\">Celestial Sphere</link> along "
"which the Sun appears to move over the course of a year. Of course, it is "
"really the Earth's orbit around the Sun causing the change in the Sun's "
"apparent direction. The ecliptic is inclined from the <link linkend=\"ai-"
"cequator\">Celestial Equator</link> by 23.5 degrees. The two points where "
"the Ecliptic crosses the Celestial Equator are known as the <link linkend="
"\"ai-equinox\">Equinoxes</link>."

"Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the planets are "
"also close to the plane of the ecliptic. In addition, the constellations of "
"the zodiac are located along the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very "
"useful line of reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the "
"constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally <quote>follow the "
"Sun</quote>."

"Because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Ecliptic, the <firstterm>Altitude</"
"firstterm> of the Sun at noon changes over the course of the year, as it "
"follows the path of the Ecliptic across the sky. This causes the seasons. In "
"the Summer, the Sun is high in the sky at noon, and it remains above the "
"<link linkend=\"ai-horizon\">Horizon</link> for more than twelve hours. "
"Whereas, in the winter, the Sun is low in the sky at noon, and remains above "
"the Horizon for less than twelve hours. In addition, sunlight is received at "
"the Earth's surface at a more direct angle in the Summer, which means that a "
"given area at the surface receives more energy per second in the Summer than "
"in Winter. The differences in day duration and in energy received per unit "
"area lead to the differences in temperature we experience in Summer and "
"Winter."

"Make sure your location is set to somewhere that is not very near the "
"equator for these experiments. Open the <guilabel>Configure - &kstars;</"
"guilabel> window, and switch to Horizontal coordinates, with the Opaque "
"Ground shown. Open the <guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window (<keycombo "
"action=\"simul\">&Ctrl;<keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>),and change the Date to "
"sometime in the middle of Summer, and the Time to 12:00 Noon. Back in the "
"Main Window, point toward the Southern Horizon (press <keycap>S</keycap>). "
"Note the height of the Sun above the Horizon at Noon in the Summer. Now, "
"change the Date to something in the middle of Winter (but keep the Time at "
"12:00 Noon). The Sun is now much lower in the Sky. You will also notice that "
"the day durations are different if you open the <guilabel>What's up Tonight?"
"</guilabel> tool for each date."
