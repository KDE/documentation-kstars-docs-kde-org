"This tool displays a model of our solar system as seen from above. The Sun "
"is drawn as a yellow dot in the center of the plot, and the orbits of the "
"planets are drawn as ellipses with the correct shapes and orientations. The "
"current position of each planet along its orbit is drawn as a colored dot, "
"along with a name label. The display can be zoomed in and out with the "
"<keycap>+</keycap> and <keycap>-</keycap> keys, and the display can be "
"recentered with the arrow keys, or by double-clicking anywhere in the window "
"with the mouse. You can also center on a planet with the <keycap>0</"
"keycap>&ndash;<keycap>9</keycap> keys (<keycap>0</keycap> is the Sun; "
"<keycap>9</keycap> is Pluto). If you center on a planet, it will be tracked "
"as time passes in the tool."

"The Solar System Viewer has its own clock, independent of the clock in the "
"main &kstars; window. There is a timestep control widget here, similar to "
"the one in the main window's toolbar. However, this control defaults to a "
"timestep of 1 day (so that the motions of the planets can be seen), and it "
"starts out with the clock paused when the tool is opened. You may set the "
"date to now by pressing the <guibutton>Today</guibutton> button."

"The current model used for Pluto's orbit is only good for dates within about "
"100 years of the present date. If you let the Solar System clock advance "
"beyond this range, you will see Pluto behave very strangely! We are aware of "
"this issue, and will try to improve Pluto's orbit model soon."
