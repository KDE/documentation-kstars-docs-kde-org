"``Server``: To prepare a device for remote control, follow the same steps in "
"the :ref:`local/server <indi-indi-setup>` setup. When you start a device "
"service in the ``Device Manager``, a port number is displayed under the "
"``Port`` column. In addition to the port number, you also need the hostname "
"or IP address of your server."

"``Client``: Select the ``Tools`` → ``Devices`` → ``Device Manager...`` menu "

"host by clicking on the ``Add`` button. Enter the hostname/IP address of the "
"server in the ``Host``: field, and enter the port number obtained from the "
"*server* machine in step 1."

"Since INDI is an independent backend component, you can run an INDI server "
"on a host without KStars. INDI can be compiled separately to run on remote "
