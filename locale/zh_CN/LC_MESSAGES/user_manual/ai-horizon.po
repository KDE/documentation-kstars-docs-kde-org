"The *Horizon* is the line that separates Earth from Sky. More precisely, it "
"is the line that divides all of the directions you can possibly look into "
"two categories: those which intersect the Earth, and those which do not. At "
"many locations, the Horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc. "
"However, if you are on a ship at sea, the Horizon is strikingly apparent."
