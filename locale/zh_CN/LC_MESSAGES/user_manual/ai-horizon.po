"The <firstterm>Horizon</firstterm> is the line that separates Earth from "
"Sky. More precisely, it is the line that divides all of the directions you "
"can possibly look into two categories: those which intersect the Earth, and "
"those which do not. At many locations, the Horizon is obscured by trees, "
"buildings, mountains, &etc; However, if you are on a ship at sea, the "
"Horizon is strikingly apparent."

"it is the locus of points which have an <firstterm>Altitude</firstterm> of "
"zero degrees."
