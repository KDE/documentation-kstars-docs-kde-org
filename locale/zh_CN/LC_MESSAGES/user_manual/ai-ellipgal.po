"Elliptical galaxies are spheroidal concentrations of billions of stars that "
"resemble Globular Clusters on a grand scale. They have very little internal "
"structure; the density of stars declines smoothly from the concentrated "
"center to the diffuse edge, and they can have a broad range of ellipticities "
"(or aspect ratios). They typically contain very little interstellar gas and "
"dust, and no young stellar populations (although there are exceptions to "
"these rules). Edwin Hubble referred to Elliptical galaxies as “early-type” "
"galaxies, because he thought that they evolved to become Spiral Galaxies "
"(which he called “late-type” galaxies). Astronomers actually now believe the "
"opposite is the case (i.e., that Spiral galaxies can turn into Elliptical "
"galaxies), but Hubble's early- and late-type labels are still used."

"Once thought to be a simple galaxy type, ellipticals are now known to be "
"quite complex objects. Part of this complexity is due to their amazing "
"history: ellipticals are thought to be the end product of the merger of two "
"Spiral galaxies. You can view a computer simulation MPEG movie of such a "
"merger at `this NASA HST webpage <http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/"
