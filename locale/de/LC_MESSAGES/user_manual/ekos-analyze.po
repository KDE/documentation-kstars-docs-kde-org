"The Analyze Module records and displays what happened in an imaging session. "
"That is, it does not control any if your imaging, but rather reviews what "
"occurred. Sessions are stored in an ``analyze`` folder, a sister folder to "
"the main logging folder. The ``.analyze`` files written there can be loaded "
"into the Analyze tab to be viewed. Analyze also can display data from the "
"current imaging session."

"When a new session begins (e.g. Ekos is disconnected at dawn, then "
"reconnected at sunset) the system will start writing a new .analyze file. "
"(This behavior can be controlled from the Analyze settings reached by "
"clicking the options button on the lower right.)"

"There are two main graphs, ``Timeline`` and ``Stats``. They are coordinatedâ€”"
"they always display the same time interval from the Ekos session, though the "
"x-axis of the ``Timeline`` shows seconds elapsed from the start of the log, "
"and ``Stats`` shows clock time. The x-axis can be zoomed in and out with the "
"``+``/``-`` buttons, as well as with standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g.  zoom-"
"in == **Ctrl**\\ +\\ **+**) The x-axis can be panned with the scroll bar as "
"well as with the left and right arrow keys. You can view your current "
"imaging session, or review old sessions by loading ``.analyze`` files using "
"the Input dropdown. Using the `<<` and `>>` buttons allows you to display "
"the previous or following .analyze files chronologically.  Checking ``Full "
"Width`` displays all the data, and ``Latest`` displays the most recent data "
"(you can control the width by zooming)."

"The three main displays can be hidden to make more room for the other "
"displays. There are checkboxes to the left of the section titles (Timeline, "
"Statistics, and Details) that enable and hide the displays."

msgid ""
"Timeline shows the major Ekos processes, and when they were active. For "
"instance, the ``Capture`` line shows when images were taken (wither green "
"for RGB or color-coded by the filter) and when imaging was aborted (shown as "
"red sections). Clicking on a capture section gives information about that "
"image, and double clicking on one brings up the image taken then in a "
"fitsviewer, if it is available."

"If you have moved your captured images, you can set an ``alternate "
"directory`` in the analyze settings page you can reach from the Options "
"button in the lower right. This alternate directory would be prepended to "
"the base of part of the original file path and would be checked if the image "
"file is not in its original location."

"Clicking on a ``Focus`` segment shows focus session information and displays "
"up the position vs HFR measurements from that session. Clicking on a "
"``Guider`` segment shows a drift plot from that session, (if it's guiding) "
"and the session's RMS statistics. Other timelines show status information "
"when clicked."

"A variety of statistics can be displayed on the ``Statistics`` graph. There "
"are too many for all to be shown in a readable way, so select among them "
"with the checkboxes. A reasonable way to start might be to use ``rms``, "
"``snr`` (using the internal guider with SEP Multistar), and ``hfr`` (if you "
"have auto-compute HFR in the FITS options). Experiment with others."

"The left axis shown is initially appropriate only for RA/DEC error, drift, "
"RMS error, RA/DEC pulses, and HFR, plotted in arc-seconds and defaulting to "
"a range of -2 to 5 arc-seconds. However, clicking on one of boxes below the "
"Statistics graph (that shows a statistic's value) will set that statistic's "
"range as the range shown on the left-axis.  Double clicking on that box will "
"bring up a menu allowing you to adjust the statistic's plotted y-range (e.g. "
"setting it to auto, explicitly typing in the range, setting it back to its "
"default value, and also changing the color of that statistic's plot)."

"The statistic shown on the left axis can also be scaled (awkwardly) using "
"the mouse wheel. It can be panned by dragging the mouse up or down over the "
"left axis' numbers.  Clicking anywhere inside the Statistics graph fills in "
"the values of the displayed statistics. Checking the latest box causes the "
"most recent values (from a live session) to be the statistics displayed. "
"This graph is zoomed and panned horizontally in coordination with the "
"timeline."
