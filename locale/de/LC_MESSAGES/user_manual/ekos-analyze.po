"The Analyze Module records and displays what happened in an imaging session. "
"That is, it does not control any if your imaging, but rather reviews what "
"occurred. Sessions are stored in an <filename class=\"directory\">analyze</"
"filename> folder, a sister folder to the main logging folder. The <literal "
"role=\"extension\">.analyze</literal> files written there can be loaded into "
"the <guilabel>Analyze</guilabel> tab to be viewed. <guilabel>Analyze</"
"guilabel> also can display data from the current imaging session."

"When a new session begins (e.g. Ekos is disconnected at dawn, then "
"reconnected at sunset) the system will start writing a new .analyze file. "
"(This behavior can be controlled from the Analyze settings reached by "

"There are two main graphs, <guilabel>Timeline</guilabel> and "
"<guilabel>Stats</guilabel>. They are coordinated&mdash;they always display "
"the same time interval from the Ekos session, though the x-axis of the "
"<guilabel>Timeline</guilabel> shows seconds elapsed from the start of the "
"log, and <guilabel>Stats</guilabel> shows clock time. The x-axis can be "
"zoomed in and out with the <guibutton>+/-</guibutton> buttons, as well as "
"with standard keyboard shortcuts (&eg; zoom-in == <keycombo>&Ctrl;<keycap>+</"
"keycap></keycombo>) The x-axis can be panned with the scroll bar as well as "
"with the left and right arrow keys. You can view your current imaging "
"session, or review old sessions by loading <literal role=\"extension\">."
"analyze</literal> files using the <guilabel>Input</guilabel> dropdown. Using "
"the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; buttons allows you to display the previous or "
"following .analyze files chronologically. Checking <guilabel>Full Width</"
"guilabel> displays all the data, and <guilabel>Latest</guilabel> displays "
"the most recent data (you can control the width by zooming)."

"Timeline shows the major Ekos processes, and when they were active. For "

"(wither green for RGB or color-coded by the filter) and when imaging was "
"aborted (shown as red sections). Clicking on a capture section gives "
"information about that image, and double clicking on one brings up the image "
"taken then in a fitsviewer, if it is available."

"If you have moved your captured images, you can set an <guilabel>alternate "

"Options button in the lower right. This alternate directory would be "
"prepended to the base of part of the original file path and would be checked "
"if the image file is not in its original location."

"The left axis shown is initially appropriate only for RA/DEC error, drift, "
"RMS error, RA/DEC pulses, and HFR, plotted in arc-seconds and defaulting to "
"a range of -2 to 5 arc-seconds. However, clicking on one of boxes below the "
"Statistics graph (that shows a statistic's value) will set that statistic's "
"range as the range shown on the left-axis. Double clicking on that box will "
"bring up a menu allowing you to adjust the statistic's plotted y-range (e.g. "
"setting it to auto, explicitly typing in the range, setting it back to its "
"default value, and also changing the color of that statistic's plot)."

"Statistics graph fills in the values of the displayed statistics. Checking "
"the latest box causes the most recent values (from a live session) to be the "
"statistics displayed. This graph is zoomed and panned horizontally in "
"coordination with the timeline."
