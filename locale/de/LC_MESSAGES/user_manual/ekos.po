"**Ekos** is an advanced cross-platform (Windows®, Mac® OS, Linux®) "
"observatory control and automation tool with a particular focus on "
"Astrophotography. It is based on a modular extensible framework to perform "
"common astrophotography tasks.  This includes highly accurate GOTOs using "
"astrometry solver, ability to measure *and* correct polar alignment errors, "
"auto-focus & auto-guide capabilities, and capture of single or stack of "
"images with filter wheel support. Ekos is shipped with KStars."
