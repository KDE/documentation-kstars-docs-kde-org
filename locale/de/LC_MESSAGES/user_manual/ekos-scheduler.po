"The Ekos Scheduler is an important component of your imaging workflow. It "
"connects to INDI, starts and stops all the other Ekos modules, schedules "
"jobs according to their constraints and priorities, monitors those jobs as "
"they execute, and then safely brings down the system when jobs are done, or "
"before dawn. Whether you are running multi-day imaging sessions for multiple "
"targets, or simply trying to image a single target for a few hours, it is "
"advisable to have the Scheduler control your imaging sessions."

"description of what types of images should be captured, constraints about "
"when the jobs should run (e.g. altitude, twilight, moon, landscape "

"looks at the job's images already captured on disk, and doesn't re-capture "

"stopping and starting when they are runnable, then jobs re-start right where "
"they left off. This works well with the ``Repeat until terminated`` job-"

"A large overlap will make frame stitching easier during post-processing, but "

"grid with 75% overlap has 16 sub-frames covering the central intersection, "
"which is enough for Winsorized Sigma rejection. Although the resulting stack "
