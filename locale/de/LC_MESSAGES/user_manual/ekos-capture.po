"exposure vs a 30 second sub-exposure. The 300 second sub-exposure had a "
"calculated noise of 22.1, resulting in a sub-exposure time/noise ratio of "
"13.6. When the 'noise increase %' is raised to force the exposure time down "
"to 30 seconds, we see a calculated noise of 9.47, resulting in a much lower "
"sub-exposure time/noise ratio of 3.2. The 300 second exposure is of "
"significantly higher potential quality than the 30 second exposure. We will "
"demand the default time/noise ratio of 80 for integration in both of these "
"cases."
