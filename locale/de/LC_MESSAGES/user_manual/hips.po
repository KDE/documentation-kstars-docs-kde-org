"KStars provides support for HiPS: Hierarchical Progressive Surveys. HiPS "
"provides multi-resolution progressive surveys to be overlayed directly in "
"client applications. It provides an immersive experience as you can explore "
"the night sky dynamically. With over 200+ surveys across the whole "
"electromagnetic spectrum from radio, infrared, visual, to even gamma rays, "
"the user can pan and zoom progressively deeper into the data visually."

"Under the submenu, a list of enabled surveys are listed. Click on the survey "
"of interest to activate it. You can only activate one-overlay at a time. "
"After activating the survey, KStars shall begin downloading the data in the "
"background and progressively overlay the images unto the sky map as they "
"become ready. Zooming in usually requires another patch of images that "
"should trigger another download cycle."
