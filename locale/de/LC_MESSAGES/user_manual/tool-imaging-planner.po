"The Imaging Planner tool helps users choose which objects to image. Users "
"can download catalogs of recommended objects, or possibly create and share "
"their own catalogs. The tool computes when the objects in a read-in catalog "
"may be imaged on the selected night given constraints such as minimum "
"altitude, terrain and moon separation. It can sort the objects along several "
"different dimensions including the number of hours an object may be imaged "
"tonight (given the users geography, constraints and possibly artificial "
"horizon), its peak altitude, distance from the moon, constellation, name and "
"type. Objects can also be filtered out for several reasons (e.g. type of "
"object, whether it was previously imaged, keywords the user has added, "
"whether the object has been selected, user not interested, etc). This tool "
"helps users research the objects by showing small images of the objects, "
"showing the objects' sky locations on the skymap, and by providing links to "
"follow to internet sites with more information and images. It allows users "
"to attach notes and links to objects, and select certain of them for further "
"consideration. This tool can be used in conjection with the Ekos imager or "
"any other imaging tool. It does not currently directly interact with the "
"actual imager; it only helps the user decide what to image."
