"You can define profiles for your equipment and their connection mode using "
"the ``Profile Editor``. Ekos comes pre-installed with the ``Simulators`` "
"profile which can be used to start simulator devices for demonstration "
"purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/ekos-profile-editor.rst:10
msgid ""
"``Connection Mode``: Ekos can be started either locally or remotely. Local "
"mode is when Ekos is running in the same machine as INDI server, i.e. all "
"the devices are connected directly to the machine. If you run INDI server on "
"a remote machine (for example, on a Raspberry PI), you need to set the INDI "
"server host and port."

#: ../../user_manual/ekos-profile-editor.rst:12
msgid ""
"``Auto Connect``: Check this option to enable automatic connection to all "
"your devices after INDI server is started. If unchecked, INDI devices are "
"created but not automatically connected. This is useful when you want to "
"make changes to the driver (e.g. change baud rate or IP address or any other "
"settings) *before* you connect to it."

msgid ""
"``Port Selector``: Check this option to enable Port Selector. When creating "
"a new profile, it is checked by default. Port Selector is used to select "
"initial serial and network communication parameters for the devices in the "
"equipment profile. After connecting to equipment for the first time, the "
"Port Selector popup is displayed where the communication parameters can be "
"set before establishing connection. Once connected, the Port Selector option "
"is turned off. It can be toggled to checked in the profile editor to enable "
"it back."

"``Site Info``: Optionally, you can check the ``Site Info`` checkbox and Ekos "
"will load the **current** city and timezone whenever is Ekos is started with "
"this profile. This can be useful when connecting to the remote geographic "
"site so that Ekos is in sync location and time wise."

"``Device Selection``: Select your devices from each category. Please note "
"that if you have a CCD with a guide head, you can leave the guider drop-down "
"menu *blank* as Ekos will auto-detect the guide head from the CCD camera. "
"Similarly, if your CCD includes embedded filter wheel support, then you do "
"*not* need to specify the filter wheel device in the filter drop-down menu."

"``Scripts``: Adjust pre-driver and post-driver delays and scripts for each "
"driver. A rule can be defined for each driver in case there is a need to "
"introduce delays before and/or after starting a particular driver. The "
"fields before the driver selection dropdown are to be executed *before* the "
"driver is started, whereas the fields after the driver selection dropdown "
"are to be executed *after* the driver started. The script field, if "
"specified, should include the full path to an executable script with the "
"appropriate permissions.  All drivers configured in the scripts editor would "
"be started first and in order before the rest of the equipment profile "
"drivers."
