"are a ComboBox showing the name and icon of each detected extension, and a "
"start/stop button. If the extension fails to close within 10 seconds of the "
"stop button being clicked, it becomes re-enabled as an abort button that "
"will force close the extension. Only one extension can be used at a time."

"It may appear on initial investigation that using the Qt DBus Adaptors "
"system would be much easier than direct use of the Qt DBus Interfaces/"
"Messages and KStars does provide the required xml definitions.  However "
"currently there is heavy use of custom types, the definitions of which are "
"combined with other information in the KStars sources. This results in a "
"large set of files from KStars that require inclusion within an extension in "
"order to make use of the Qt DBus Adaptors. Hopefully this will be addressed "
"in the future."
