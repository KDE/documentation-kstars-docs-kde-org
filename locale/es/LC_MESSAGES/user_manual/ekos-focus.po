"<emphasis role=\"bold\">Iterative</emphasis>: In the Iterative algorithm, "
"Ekos operates iteratively by moving in discrete steps, decided initially by "
"the user-configurable step size and later by the slope of the V-Curve, to "
"get closer to the optimal focus position where it then changes gears and "
"performs smaller, finer moves to reach the optimal focus. The focus process "
"stops when the measured HFR is within the configurable tolerance of the "
"minimum recorded HFR in the process. In other words, whenever the process "
"starts searching for a solution within a narrowly limited range, it checks "
"if the current HFR is within % difference compared to the minimum HFR "
"recorded, and if this condition is met then the Autofocus process is "
"considered successful. The default value is set to 1% and is sufficient for "
"most situations. The Step options specify the number of initial ticks the "
"focuser has to move. If the image is severely out of focus, we set the step "
"size high (i.e. greater than 250). On the other hand, if the focus is close "
"to optimal focus, we set the step size to a more reasonable range (less than "
"50). It takes trial and error to find the best starting tick, but Ekos only "
"uses that for the first focus motion, as all subsequent motions depend on "
"the V-Curve slope calculations. Key features include:"
